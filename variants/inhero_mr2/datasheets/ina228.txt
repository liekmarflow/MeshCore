3 Description

The INA228 is an ultra-precise digital power monitor
with a 20-bit delta-sigma ADC specifically designed
for current-sensing applications. The device can
measure a full-scale differential input of ±163.84 mV
or ±40.96 mV across a resistive shunt sense element
with common-mode voltage support from –0.3 V to

+85 V.

The INA228 reports current, bus voltage, temperature,
power, energy and charge accumulation while
employing a precision ±0.5% integrated oscillator,
all  while performing the needed calculations in the
background. The integrated temperature sensor is

±1°C accurate for die temperature measurement
and is useful in monitoring the system ambient
temperature.

The low offset and gain drift design of the INA228
allows the device to be used in precise systems
that do not undergo multi-temperature calibration
during manufacturing. Further, the very low offset
voltage and noise allow for use in mA to kA
sensing applications and provide a wide dynamic
range without significant power dissipation losses
on the sensing shunt element. The low input bias
current of the device permits the use of larger current-
sense  resistors,  thus  providing  accurate  current
measurements in the micro-amp range.

The device allows for selectable ADC conversion
times from 50 µs to 4.12 ms as well as sample
averaging from 1x to 1024x, which further helps
reduce the noise of the measured data.

7 Detailed Description

7.1 Overview

The INA228 device is a digital current sense amplifier with an I2C digital interface. It measures 
shunt voltage,
bus voltage and internal temperature while calculating current, power, energy and charge necessary 
for
accurate decision making in precisely controlled systems. Programmable registers allow flexible 
configuration
for measurement precision as well as continuous or triggered operation. Detailed register 
information is found in
Section 7.6.

7.3.1 Versatile High Voltage Measurement Capability

The INA228 operates off a 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply but can measure voltage and current on rails as 
high as 85

V. The current is measured by sensing the voltage drop across a external shunt resistor at the IN+ 
and IN–
pins. The input stage of the INA228 is designed such that the input common-mode voltage can be 
higher than
the device supply voltage, VS. The supported common-mode voltage range at the input pins is –0.3 V 
to +85
V, which makes the device well suited for both high-side and low-side current measurements. There 
are no
special considerations for power-supply sequencing because the common-mode input range and device 
supply
voltage are independent of each other; therefore, the bus voltage can be present with the supply 
voltage off, and
vice-versa without damaging the device.

The device also measures the bus supply voltage through the VBUS pin and temperature through the 
integrated
temperature sensor. The differential shunt voltage is measured between the IN+ and IN– pins, while 
the bus
voltage is measured with respect to device ground. Monitored bus voltages can range from 0 V to 85 
V, while
monitored temperatures can range from -40 ºC to +125 ºC.

Shunt voltage, bus voltage, and temperature measurements are multiplexed internally to a single ADC 
as shown
in Figure 7-1.

7.3.2 Internal Measurement and Calculation Engine

The current and charge are calculated after a shunt voltage measurement, while the power and energy 
are
calculated after a bus voltage measurement. Power and energy are calculated based on the previous 
current
calculation and the latest bus voltage measurement. If the value loaded into the SHUNT_CAL register 
is zero,
the power, energy and charge values will be reported as zero.

The current, voltage, and temperature values are immediate results when the number of averages is 
set to one
as shown in Figure 7-2. However, when averaging is used, each ADC measurement is an intermediate 
result
which is stored in the corresponding averaging registers. Following every ADC sample, the 
newly-calculated
values for current, voltage, and temperature are appended to their corresponding averaging 
registers until the
set number of averages is achieved. After all of the samples have been measured the average current 
and
voltage is determined, the power is calculated and the results are loaded to the corresponding 
output registers
where they can then be read.

The energy and charge values are accumulated for each conversion cycle. Therefore the INA228 
averaging
function is not applied to these.

Calculations for power, charge and energy are performed in the background and do not add to the 
overall
conversion time.

7.3.3 Low Bias Current

The INA228 features very low input bias current which provides several benefits. The low input bias 
current of
the INA228 reduces the current consumed by the device in both active and shutdown state. Another 
benefit
of low bias current is that it allows the use of input filters to reject high-frequency noise 
before the signal is
converted to digital data. In traditional digital current-sense amplifiers, the addition of input 
filters comes at
the cost of reduced accuracy. However, as a result of the low bias current, the reduction in 
accuracy due to
input filters is minimized. An additional benefit of low bias current is the ability to use a 
larger shunt resistor to
accurately sense smaller currents. Use of a larger value for the shunt resistor allows the device 
to accurately
monitor currents in the sub-mA range.

The bias current in the INA228 is the smallest when the sensed current is zero. As the current 
starts to increase,
the differential voltage drop across the shunt resistor increases which results in an increase in 
the bias current
as shown in Figure 6-14.

7.3.4 High-Precision Delta-Sigma ADC

The integrated ADC is a high-performance, low-offset, low-drift, delta-sigma ADC designed to support
bidirectional current flow at the shunt voltage measurement channel. The measured inputs are 
selected through
the high-voltage input multiplexer to the ADC inputs as shown in Figure 7-1. The ADC architecture 
enables
lower drift measurement across temperature and consistent offset measurements across the common-mode
voltage, temperature, and power supply variations. A low-offset ADC is preferred in current sensing 
applications
to provide a near 0-V offset voltage that maximizes the useful dynamic range of the system.

ADC conversion time for each input can be set independently by the VSHCT, VBUSCT, and VTCT bits in 
register
ADC_CONFIG, respectively, in the range of 50 µs to 4.12 ms. Furthermore, a sample averaging 
function in the

INA228

SLYS021A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2022                                          www.ti.com

range of 1x to 1024x is implemented and can be selected by the AVG bits in ADC_CONFIG register. The 
sample
conversion time and the averaging are a part of the integrated digital filter described in Section 
7.3.4.1.

The INA228 can measure the shunt voltage, bus voltage, and die temperature, or a combination of any 
based
on the selected MODE bits setting in the ADC_CONFIG register. This permits selecting modes to 
convert
only the shunt voltage or bus voltage to further allow the user to configure the monitoring 
function to fit the
specific application requirements. When no averaging is selected, once an ADC conversion is 
completed, the
converted values are independently updated in their corresponding registers where they can be read 
through
the digital interface at the time of conversion end. The conversion time for shunt voltage, bus 
voltage, and
temperature inputs are set independently from 50 µs to 4.12ms depending on the values programmed in 
the
ADC_CONFIG register. Enabled measurement inputs are converted sequentially so the total time to 
convert
all   inputs depends on the conversion time for each input and the number of inputs enabled. When 
averaging
is used, the intermediate values are subsequently stored in an averaging accumulator, and the 
conversion
sequence repeats until the number of averages is reached. After all of the averaging has been 
completed, the
final values are updated in the corresponding registers that can then be read. These values remain 
in the data
output registers until they are replaced by the next fully completed conversion results. In this 
case, reading the
data output registers does not affect a conversion in progress.

The ADC has two conversion modes—continuous and triggered—set by the MODE bits in ADC_CONFIG
register. In continuous-conversion mode, the ADC will continuously convert the input measurements 
and update
the output registers as described above in an indefinite loop. In triggered-conversion mode, the 
ADC will convert
the input measurements as described above, after which the ADC will go into shutdown mode until 
another
single-shot trigger is generated by writing to the MODE bits. Writing the MODE bits will interrupt 
and restart
triggered or continuous conversions that are in progress. Although the device can be read at any 
time, and
the data from the last conversion remains available, the Conversion Ready flag (CNVRF bit in 
DIAG_ALRT
register) is provided to help coordinate triggered conversions. This bit is set after all 
conversions and averaging
is completed.

The Conversion Ready flag (CNVRF) clears under these conditions:

• Writing to the ADC_CONFIG register (except for selecting shutdown mode); or

• Reading the DIAG_ALRT Register

While the INA228 device is used in either one of the conversion modes, a dedicated digital engine 
is calculating
the current, power, charge and energy values in the background as described in Section 7.3.2. In 
triggered
mode, the accumulation registers (ENERGY and CHARGE) are invalid, as the device does not keep track 
of
elapsed time. For applications that need critical measurements in regards to accumulation of time 
for energy and
charge measurements, the device must be configured to use continuous conversion mode, as the 
accumulated
results are continuously updated and can provide true system representation of charge and energy 
consumption
in  a system. All of the calculations are performed in the background and do not contribute to 
conversion time.

For applications that must synchronize with other components in the system, the INA228 conversion 
can be
delayed by programming the CONVDLY bits in CONFIG register in the range between 0 (no delay) and 510
ms. The resolution in programming the conversion delay is 2 ms. The conversion delay is set to 0 by 
default.
Conversion delay can assist in measurement synchronization when multiple external devices are used 
for
voltage or current monitoring purposes. In applications where an time aligned voltage and current 
measurements
are needed, two devices can be used with the current measurement delayed such that the external 
voltage and
current measurements will occur at approximately the same time. Keep in mind that even though the 
internal
time base for the ADC is precise, synchronization will be lost over time due to internal and 
external time base
mismatch.

7.3.4.1 Low Latency Digital Filter

The device integrates a low-pass digital filter that performs both decimation and filtering on the 
ADC output
data, which helps with noise reduction. The digital filter is automatically adjusted for the 
different output data
rates and always settles within one conversion cycle. The user has the flexibility to choose 
different output
conversion time periods TCT from 50 µs to 4.12 ms. With this configuration the first amplitude 
notch appears
at   the Nyquist frequency of the output signal which is determined by the selected conversion time 
period and
defined as fNOTCH= 1 / (2 x TCT). This means that the filter cut-off frequency will scale 
proportionally with the

7.3.4.2 Flexible Conversion Times and Averaging

ADC conversion times for shunt voltage, bus voltage and temperature can be set independently from 
50 μs to

4.12 ms. The flexibility in conversion time allows for robust operation in a variety of noisy 
environments. The
device also allows for programmable averaging times from a single conversion all the way to an 
average of
1024 conversions. The amount of averaging selected applies uniformly to all active measurement 
inputs. The
ADC_CONFIG register shown in Table 7-6 provides additional details on the supported conversion 
times and
averaging modes. The INA228 effective resolution of the ADC can be increased by increasing the 
conversion
time and increasing the number of averages. Figure 7-4 and Figure 7-5 shown below illustrate the 
effect of
conversion time and averaging on a constant input signal.

Settings for the conversion time and number of conversions averaged impact the effective measurement
resolution. For more detailed information on how averaging reduces noise and increases the 
effective number of
bits (ENOB) see Section 8.1.3.

7.3.5 Shunt Resistor Drift Compensation

The INA228 device has an internal temperature sensor which can measure die temperature from –40 °C 
to +125

°C. The accuracy of the temperature sensor is ±2 °C across the operational temperature range. The 
temperature
value is stored inside the DIETEMP register and can be read through the digital interface.

The device has the capability to utilize the temperature measurement to compensate for shunt 
resistor
temperature variance. This feature can be enabled by setting the TEMPCOMP bit in the CONFIG 
register, while
the SHUNT_TEMPCO is the register that can be programmed to enter the temperature coefficient of the 
used
shunt. The full scale value of the SHUNT_TEMPCO register is 16384 ppm/°C. The temperature 
compensation
is referenced to +25 °C . The shunt is always assumed to have a positive temperature coefficient 
and the
temperature compensation follows Equation 1:


RADJ = RNOM +

RNOM x (DIETEMP - 25) x SHUNT_TEMPCO

106                                       (1)

where

•  RNOM is the nominal shunt resistance in Ohms at 25 °C.

• DIETEMP is the temperature value in the DIETEMP register in °C.

• SHUNT_TEMPCO is the shunt temperature coefficient in ppm/°C.

When this feature is enabled and correctly programmed, the CURRENT register data is corrected by 
constantly
monitoring the die temperature and becomes a function of temperature. The effectiveness of the 
compensation
will depend on how well the resistor and the INA228 are thermally coupled since the die temperature 
of the
INA228 is used for the compensation.

Note

Warning: If temperature compensation is enabled under some conditions, the calculated current
result may be lower than the actual value. This condition typically occurs when there is a high 
value
of shunt voltage ( >70% of full range), there is a shunt with high temperature-coefficient value ( 
>2000
ppm/°C), and there is a high temperature ( >100°C). Consider the example of constant current flowing
through a high temperature coefficient shunt such that at lower temperatures the shunt voltage is
in  its upper range. As the temperature increases, the device will correctly report a constant 
current
until the maximum shunt voltage is reached. As temperature continues to increase after the maximum
shunt voltage is reached, the device will start reporting lower currents. This is because the 
effective
resistance calculated will continue to increase while the detected shunt voltage will remain 
constant
due  to the voltage exceeding the selected ADC range.

7.3.6 Integrated Precision Oscillator

The internal timebase of the device is provided by an internal oscillator that is trimmed to less 
than 0.5%
tolerance at room temperature. The precision oscillator is the timing source for ADC conversions, 
as well as
the time-count used for calculation of energy and charge. The digital filter response varies with 
conversion time;
therefore, the precise clock ensures filter response and notch frequency consistency across 
temperature. On
power up, the internal oscillator and ADC take roughly 300 µs to reach <1% error stability. Once 
the clock
stabilizes, the ADC data output will be accurate to the electrical specifications provided in 
Section 6.

7.3.7 Multi-Alert Monitoring and Fault Detection

The INA228 includes a multipurpose, open-drain ALERT output pin that can be used to report multiple
diagnostics or as an indicator that the ADC conversion is complete when the device is operating in 
both
triggered and continuous conversion mode. The diagnostics listed in Table 7-1 are constantly 
monitored and can

A read of the DIAG_ALRT register is used to determine which diagnostic has triggered the ALERT pin. 
This
register, shown in Table 7-16, is also used to monitor other associated diagnostics as well as 
configure some
ALERT pin functions.

• Alert latch enable — In case the ALERT pin is triggered, this function will hold the value of the 
pin even after
all diagnostic conditions have cleared. A read of the DIAG_ALRT register will reset the status of 
the ALERT
pin. This function is enabled by setting the ALATCH bit.

•  Conversion ready enable — Enables the ALERT pin to assert when an ADC conversion has completed 
and
output values are ready to be read through the digital interface. This function is enabled by 
setting the CNVR
bit. The conversion completed events can also be read through the CNVRF bit regardless of the CNVR 
bit
setting.

• Alert comparison on averaged output — Allows the out-of-range threshold value to be compared to 
the
averaged data values produced by the ADC. This helps to additionally remove noise from the output 
data
when compared to the out-of-range threshold to avoid false alerts due to noise. However, the 
diagnostic will
be delayed due to the time needed for averaging. This function is enabled by setting the SLOWALERT 
bit.

•  Alert polarity — Allows the device to invert the active state of the ALERT pin. Note that the 
ALERT pin is an
open-drain output that must be pulled-up by a resistor. The ALERT pin is active-low by default and 
can be
configured for active high function using the APOL control bit.

Other diagnostic functions that are not reported by the ALERT pin but are available by reading the 
DIAG_ALRT
register:

•  Math overflow — Indicated by the MATHOF bit, reports when an arithmetic operation has caused an 
internal
register overflow.

•  Memory status — Indicated by the MEMSTAT bit, monitors the health of the device non-volatile 
trim memory.
This bit should always read '1' when the device is operating properly.

•  Energy overflow — Indicated by the ENERGYOF bit, reports when the ENERGY register has reached an
overflow state due to data accumulation.

•  Charge overflow — Indicated by the CHARGEOF bit, reports when the CHARGE register has reached an
overflow state due to data accumulation.

When the ALERT pin is configured to report the ADC conversion complete event, the ALERT pin becomes 
a
multipurpose reporting output. Figure 7-6 shows an example where the device reports ADC conversion 
complete
events while the INA228 device is subject to shunt over voltage (over current) event, bus under 
voltage event,
over temperature event and over power-limit event.

7.4 Device Functional Modes

7.4.1 Shutdown Mode

Figure 7-6. Multi-Alert Configuration

In addition to the two conversion modes (continuous and triggered), the device also has a shutdown 
mode
(selected by the MODE bits in ADC_CONFIG register) that reduces the quiescent current to less than 
5 µA and
turns off current into the device inputs, reducing the impact of supply drain when the device is 
not being used.
The registers of the device can be written to and read from while the device is in shutdown mode. 
The device
remains in shutdown mode until another triggered conversion command or continuous conversion 
command is
received.

The device can be triggered to perform conversions while in shutdown mode. When a conversion is 
triggered,
the                                                        ADC will start conversion; once 
conversion completes the device will return to the shutdown state.

Note that the shutdown current is specified with an inactive communications bus. Active clock and 
data activity
will increase the current consumption as a function of the bus frequency as shown in Figure 6-23.

7.4.2 Power-On Reset

Power-on reset (POR) is asserted when VS drops below 1.26V (typical) at which all of the registers 
are reset to
their default values. A manual device reset can be initiated by setting the RST bit in the CONFIG 
register. The
default power-up register values are shown in the reset column for each register description. Links 
to the register
descriptions are shown in Section 7.6.

7.5 Programming

7.5.1 I2C Serial Interface

The INA228 operates only as a secondary device on both the SMBus and I2C interfaces. Connections to 
the
bus are made through the open-drain SDA and SCL lines. The SDA and SCL pins feature integrated spike
suppression filters and Schmitt triggers to minimize the effects of input spikes and bus noise. 
Although the
device integrates spike suppression into the digital I/O lines, proper layout techniques help 
minimize the amount
of coupling into the communication lines. This noise introduction could occur from capacitive 
coupling signal
edges between the two communication lines themselves or from other switching noise sources present 
in the
system. Routing traces in parallel with ground in between layers on a printed-circuit board (PCB) 
typically
reduces the effects of coupling between the communication lines. Shielded communication lines 
reduce the
possibility of unintended noise coupling into the digital I/O lines that could be incorrectly 
interpreted as start or
stop commands.

The INA228 supports the transmission protocol for fast mode (1 kHz to 400 kHz) and high-speed mode 
(1 kHz to
2.94 MHz). All data bytes are transmitted most significant byte first and follow the SMBus 3.0 
transfer protocol.

To communicate with the INA228, the main device must first address secondary devices through a 
secondary
device address byte. The secondary device address byte consists of seven address bits and a 
direction bit that
indicates whether the action is to be a read or write operation.

The device has two address pins, A0 and A1. Table 7-2 lists the pin logic levels for each of the 16 
possible
addresses. The device samples the state of pins A0 and A1 on every bus communication. Establish the 
pin
states before any activity on the interface occurs. When connecting the SDA pin to either A0 or A1 
to set the
device address, additional hold time of 100 ns is needed on the MSB of the I2C address to insure 
correct device
addressing.

7.5.1.1 Writing to and Reading Through the I2C Serial Interface

Accessing a specific register on the INA228 is accomplished by writing the appropriate value to the 
register
pointer. Refer to Section 7.6 for a complete list of registers and corresponding addresses. The 
value for the
register pointer (as shown in Figure 7-9) is the first byte transferred after the secondary device 
address byte with
the R/W bit low. Every write operation to the device requires a value for the register pointer.

Writing to a register begins with the first byte transmitted by the main device. This byte is the 
secondary
device address, with the R/W bit low. The device then acknowledges receipt of a valid address. The 
next
byte transmitted by the main device is the address of the register to be accessed. This register 
address value
updates the register pointer to the desired internal device register. The next two bytes are 
written to the register
addressed by the register pointer. The device acknowledges receipt of each data byte. The main 
device may
terminate data transfer by generating a start or stop condition.

When reading from the device, the last value stored in the register pointer by a write operation 
determines which
register is read during a read operation. To change the register pointer for a read operation, a 
new value must
be written to the register pointer. This write is accomplished by issuing a secondary device 
address byte with
the R/ W bit low, followed by the register pointer byte. No additional data are required. The main 
device then
generates a start condition and sends the address byte for the secondary device with the R/W bit 
high to initiate
the read command. The next byte is transmitted by the secondary device and is the most significant 
byte of the
register indicated by the register pointer. This byte is followed by an Acknowledge from the main 
device; then
the secondary device transmits the least significant byte. The main device may or may not 
acknowledge receipt
of the second data byte. The main device may terminate data transfer by generating a 
Not-Acknowledge after

receiving any data byte, or generating a start or stop condition. If repeated reads from the same 
register are
desired, it is not necessary to continually send the register pointer bytes; the device retains the 
register pointer
value until it is changed by the next write operation.

Figure 7-7 shows the write operation timing diagram. Figure 7-8 shows the read operation timing 
diagram. These
diagrams are shown for reading/writing to 16 bit registers. Registers with a higher number of bytes 
will behave
similarly.

Register bytes are sent most-significant byte first, followed by the least significant byte.

7.5.1.2 High-Speed I2C Mode

When the bus is idle, both the SDA and SCL lines are pulled high by the pullup resistors. The main 
device
generates a start condition followed by a valid serial byte containing high-speed (HS) main device 
code
00001XXX. This transmission is made in fast (400 kHz) or standard (100 kHz) (F/S) mode at no more 
than
400 kHz. The device does not acknowledge the HS main device code, but does recognize it and 
switches its
internal filters to support 2.94-MHz operation.

The main device then generates a repeated start condition (a repeated start condition has the same 
timing
as the start condition). After this repeated start condition, the protocol is the same as F/S mode, 
except that

INA228

SLYS021A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2022

transmission speeds up to 2.94 MHz are allowed. Instead of using a stop condition, use repeated 
start conditions
to maintain the bus in HS-mode. A stop condition ends the HS-mode and switches all the internal 
filters of the
device to support the F/S mode.

7.5.1.3 SMBus Alert Response

The INA228 is designed to respond to the SMBus Alert Response address. The SMBus Alert Response 
provides
a quick fault identification for simple secondary devices. When an Alert occurs, the main device 
can broadcast
the Alert Response secondary device address (0001 100) with the Read/Write bit set high. Following 
this Alert
Response, any secondary device that generates an alert identifies itself by acknowledging the Alert 
Response
and sending its address on the bus.

The Alert Response can activate several different slave devices simultaneously, similar to the I2C 
General Call.
If more than one slave attempts to respond, bus arbitration rules apply. The losing device does not 
generate an
Acknowledge and continues to hold the Alert line low until that device wins arbitration.

8 Application and Implementation

Note

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,
and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for
determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their 
design
implementation to confirm system functionality.

8.1 Application Information

8.1.1 Device Measurement Range and Resolution

The INA228 device supports two input ranges for the shunt voltage measurement. The supported full 
scale
differential input across the IN+ and IN– pins can be either ±163.84 mV or ±40.96 mV depending on 
the
ADCRANGE bit in CONFIG register. The range for the bus voltage measurement is from 0 V to 85 V. The
internal die temperature sensor range extends from –256 °C to +256 °C but is limited by the package 
to –40 °C
to 125 °C.

Table 8-1 provides a description of full scale voltage on shunt, bus, and temperature measurements, 
along with
their associated step size.

The device shunt voltage measurements, bus voltage, and temperature measurements can be read 
through the
VSHUNT, VBUS, and DIETEMP registers, respectively. The digital output in VSHUNT and VBUS registers 
is
20-bits. The shunt voltage measurement can be positive or negative due to bidirectional currents in 
the system;
therefore the data value in VSHUNT can be positive or negative. The VBUS data value is always 
positive. The
output data can be directly converted into voltage by multiplying the digital value by its 
respective resolution size.
The digital output in the DIETEMP register is 16-bit and can be directly converted to °C by 
multiplying by the
above resolution size. This output value can also be positive or negative.

Furthermore, the device provides the flexibility to report calculated current in Amperes, power in 
Watts, charge in
Coulombs and energy in Joules as described in Section 8.1.2.

8.1.2 Current , Power, Energy, and Charge Calculations

For the INA228 device to report current values in Ampere units, a constant conversion value must be 
written in
the SHUNT_CAL register that is dependent on the maximum measured current and the shunt resistance 
used in
the application. The SHUNT_CAL register is calculated based on Equation 2. The term CURRENT_LSB is 
the
LSB step size for the CURRENT register where the current in Amperes is stored. The value of 
CURRENT_LSB
is based on the maximum expected current as shown in Equation 3, and it directly defines the 
resolution of the
CURRENT register. While the smallest CURRENT_LSB value yields highest resolution, it is common to 
select a
higher round-number (no higher than 8x) value for the CURRENT_LSB in order to simplify the 
conversion of the
CURRENT.

The RSHUNT term is the resistance value of the external shunt used to develop the differential 
voltage across the
IN+ and IN– pins. Use Equation 2 for ADCRANGE = 0. For ADCRANGE = 1, the value of SHUNT_CAL must be
multiplied by 4.

SHUNT_CAL = 13107.2 x 10⁶ x CURRENT_LSB x RSHUNT                       (2)

where

• 13107.2 x 106 is an internal fixed value used to ensure scaling is maintained properly.

• the value of SHUNT_CAL must be multiplied by 4 for ADCRANGE = 1.


CURRENT_LSB =

Maximum Expected Current

219

(3)

Note that the current is calculated following a shunt voltage measurement based on the value set in 
the
SHUNT_CAL register. If the value loaded into the SHUNT_CAL register is zero, the current value 
reported
through the CURRENT register is also zero.

After programming the SHUNT_CAL register with the calculated value, the measured current in Amperes 
can be
read from the CURRENT register. The final value is scaled by CURRENT_LSB and calculated in Equation 
4:

Current [A] = CURRENT_LSB x CURRENT                               (4)

where

• CURRENT is the value read from the CURRENT register

The power value can be read from the POWER register as a 24-bit value and converted to Watts by 
using
Equation 5:

Power [W] = 3.2 x CURRENT_LSB x POWER                              (5)

where

• POWER is the value read from the POWER register.

• CURRENT_LSB is the lsb size of the current calculation as defined by Equation 3.

The energy value can be read from the ENERGY register as a 40-bit unsigned value in Joules units. 
The energy
value in Joules is converted by using Equation 6:

Energy [J] = 16 x 3.2 x CURRENT_LSB x ENERGY                           (6)

The charge value can be read from the CHARGE register as a 40-bit, two's complement value in 
Coulombs. The
charge value in Coulomb is converted by using Equation 7:

Charge [C] = CURRENT_LSB x CHARGE                                (7)

where

• CHARGE is the value read from the CHARGE register.

• CURRENT_LSB is the lsb size of the current calculation as described in Equation 3.

Upon overflow, the ENERGY and CHARGE registers will roll over and start from zero. The register 
values can
also be reset at any time by setting the RSTACC bit in the CONFIG register.

For a design example using these equations refer to Section 8.2.2.

8.1.3 ADC Output Data Rate and Noise Performance

The INA228 noise performance and effective resolution depend on the ADC conversion time. The device
also supports digital averaging which can further help decrease digital noise. The flexibility of 
the device to
select ADC conversion time and data averaging offers increased signal-to-noise ratio and achieves 
the highest
dynamic range with lowest offset. The profile of the noise at lower signals levels is dominated by 
the system
noise that is comprised mainly of 1/f noise or white noise. The INA228 effective resolution of the 
ADC can be
increased by increasing the conversion time and increasing the number of averages.

Table 8-2 summarizes the output data rate conversion settings supported by the device. The fastest 
conversion
setting is 50 µs. Typical noise-free resolution is represented as Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) 
based on
device measured data. The ENOB is calculated based on noise peak-to-peak values, which assures that 
full
noise distribution is taken into consideration.

8.1.4 Input Filtering Considerations

As previously discussed, INA228 offers several options for noise filtering by allowing the user to 
select the
conversion times and number of averages independently in the ADC_CONFIG register. The conversion 
times
can be set independently for the shunt voltage and bus voltage measurements to allow added 
flexibility in
monitoring of the power-supply bus.

The internal ADC has good inherent noise rejection; however, the transients that occur at or very 
close to the
sampling rate harmonics can cause problems. Because these signals are at 1 MHz and higher, they can 
be
managed by incorporating filtering at the input of the device. Filtering high frequency signals 
enables the use of
low-value series resistors on the filter with negligible effects on measurement accuracy. For best 
results, filter
using the lowest possible series resistance (typically 100 Ω or less) and a ceramic capacitor. 
Recommended
values for this capacitor are between 0.1 µF and 1 µF. Figure 8-1 shows the device with a filter 
added at the
input.

Overload conditions are another consideration for the device inputs. The device inputs are 
specified to tolerate

±40 V differential across the IN+ and IN– pins. A large differential scenario might be a short to 
ground on the
load side of the shunt. This type of event can result in full power-supply voltage across the shunt 
(as long
the power supply or energy storage capacitors support it). Removing a short to ground can result in 
inductive
kickbacks that could exceed the 40-V differential or 85-V common-mode absolute maximum rating of 
the device.
Inductive kickback voltages are best controlled by Zener-type transient-absorbing devices (commonly 
called
transzorbs) combined with sufficient energy storage capacitance. See the Transient Robustness for 
Current
Shunt Monitors reference design which describes a high-side current shunt monitor used to measure 
the voltage
developed across a current-sensing resistor when current passes through it.

In applications that do not have large energy storage, electrolytic capacitors on one or both sides 
of the shunt,
an input overstress condition may result from an excessive dV/dt of the voltage applied to the 
input. A hard
physical short is the most likely cause of this event. This problem occurs because an excessive 
dV/dt can
activate the ESD protection in the device in systems where large currents are available. Testing 
demonstrates
that the addition of 10-Ω resistors in series with each input of the device sufficiently protects 
the inputs against
this dV/dt failure up to the 40-V maximum differential voltage rating of the device. Selecting 
these resistors in the
range noted has minimal effect on accuracy.

The low offset voltage and low input bias current of the INA228 allow accurate monitoring of a wide 
range of
currents. To accurately monitor currents with high resolution, select the value of the shunt 
resistor so that the
resulting sense voltage is close to the maximum allowable differential input voltage range (either 
±163.84 mV
or ±40.96 mV, depending on register settings). The circuit for monitoring currents in a high-side

8.2.1 Design Requirements

The INA228 measures the voltage developed across a current-sensing resistor (RSHUNT) when current 
passes
through it. The device also measures the bus supply voltage and calculates power when calibrated. 
It also
comes with alert capability, where the alert pin can be programmed to respond to a user-defined 
event or a
conversion                                                        ready notification.

The design requirements for the circuit shown in Figure 8-2 are listed in Table 8-3.

8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

8.2.2.1 Select the Shunt Resistor

Using values from Table 8-3, the maximum value of the shunt resistor is calculated based on the 
value of
the maximum current to be sensed (IMAX) and the maximum allowable sense voltage (VSENSE_MAX) for the
chosen ADC range. When operating at the maximum current, the differential input voltage must not 
exceed the
maximum full scale range of the device, VSENSE_MAX. Using Equation 8 for the given design 
parameters, the
maximum value for RSHUNT is calculated to be 16.38 mΩ. The closest standard resistor value that is 
smaller than
the maximum calculated value is 16.2 mΩ. Also keep in mind that RSHUNT must be able to handle the 
power
dissipated across it in the maximum load condition.

8.2.2.2 Configure the Device

The first step to program the INA228 is to properly set the device and ADC configuration registers. 
On initial
power up the CONFIG and ADC_CONFIG registers are set to the reset values as shown in Table 7-5 and
Table 7-6. In this default power on state the device is set to measured on the ±163.84 mV range 
with the ADC
continuously converting the shunt voltage, bus voltage, and temperature. If the default power up 
conditions do
not meet the design requirements, these registers will need to be set properly after each VS power 
cycle event.

8.2.2.3 Program the Shunt Calibration Register

The shunt calibration register needs to be correctly programmed at each VS power up in order for 
the device
to properly report any result based on current. The first step in properly setting this register is 
to calculate the
LSB value for the current by using Equation 3. Applying this equation with the maximum expected 
current of 10
A results in an LSB size of 19.0735 μA. Applying Equation 2 to the CURRENT_LSB and selected value 
for the
shunt resistor results in a shunt calibration register setting of 4050d (FD2h). Failure to set the 
value of the shunt
calibration                                                     register will result in a zero 
value for any result based on current.

8.2.2.4 Set Desired Fault Thresholds

Fault thresholds are set by programming the desired trip threshold into the corresponding fault 
register. The list
of supported fault registers is shown in Table 7-1. Since the fault limit registers are 16 bits in 
length, the effective
LSB size for these registers is 16 times greater than the corresponding 20 bit LSB used in 
calculating returned
values                                                       for bus voltage and current.

An over current threshold is set by programming the shunt over voltage limit register (SOVL). The 
voltage that
needs to be programmed into this register is calculated by multiplying the over current threshold 
by the shunt
resistor. In this example the over current threshold is 10 A and the value of the current sense 
resistor is 16.2 mΩ,
which give a shunt voltage limit of 162 mV. Once the shunt voltage limit is known, the value for 
the shunt over
voltage limit register is calculated by dividing the shunt voltage limit by the shunt voltage LSB 
size.

In this example, the calculated value of the shunt over voltage limit register is 162 mV / (312.5 
nV × 16) =
32400d (7E90h).

An over voltage fault threshold on the bus voltage is set by programming the bus over voltage limit 
register
(BOVL). In this example the desired over voltage threshold is 52 V. The value that needs to be 
programmed into
this register is calculated by dividing the target threshold voltage by the bus voltage fault limit 
LSB value of 3.125
mV. For this example, the target value for the BOVL register is 52 V / (195.3125 μV × 16) = 16640d 
(4100h).

INA228

SLYS021A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2022

When setting the power over-limit value, the LSB size used to calculate the value needed in the 
limit registers
will be 256 times greater than the power LSB. This is because the power register is a 24 bits in 
length while the
power fault limit register is 16 bits.

Values stored in the alert limit registers are set to the default values after VS power cycle 
events and need to be
reprogrammed each time power is applied.

8.2.2.5 Calculate Returned Values

Parametric values are calculated by multiplying the returned value by the LSB value. Table 8-4 
below shows the
returned values for this application example assuming the design requirements shown in Table 8-3.

Shunt Voltage, Current, Bus Voltage (positive only), Charge, and Temperature return values in two's 
complement
format. In two's complement format a negative value in binary is represented by having a 1 in the 
most
significant bit of the returned value. These values can be converted to decimal by first inverting 
all the bits
and adding 1 to obtain the unsigned binary value. This value should then be converted to decimal 
with the
negative sign applied. For example, assume a shunt voltage reading returns 1011 0100 0001 0000 
0000. This is
a negative value due to the MSB having a value of one. Inverting the bits and adding one results in 
0100 1011
1111 0000 0000 (311040d) which from the shunt voltage example in Table 8-4 correlates to a voltage 
of 97.2 mV.
Since                                                    the returned value was negative the 
measured shunt voltage value is -97.2 mV.

8.2.3 Application Curves

Figure 8-3 and Figure 8-4 show the ALERT pin response to a bus overvoltage fault with a conversion 
time of
50 μs, averaging set to 1, and the SLOWALERT bit set to 0 for bus only conversions. For these scope 
shots,
persistence was enabled on the ALERT channel to show the variation in the alert response for many 
sequential
fault events. If the magnitude of the fault is sufficient the ALERT response can be as fast as one 
quarter of the
ADC conversion time as shown in Figure 8-3. For fault conditions that are just exceeding the limit 
threshold,
the response time for the ALERT pin can vary from approximately 0.5 to 1.5 conversion cycles as 
shown in
Figure 8-4. Variation in the alert response exists because the external fault event is not 
synchronized to the
internal ADC conversion start. Also the ADC is constantly sampling to get a result, so the response 
time for fault
events starting from zero will slower than fault events starting from values near the set fault 
threshold. Since the
timing of the alert can be difficult to predict, applications where the alert timing is critical 
should assume a alert
response equal to 1.5 times the ADC conversion time for bus voltage or shunt voltage only 
conversions.

9 Power Supply Recommendations

INA228

SLYS021A – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED MAY 2022

The input circuitry of the device can accurately measure signals on common-mode voltages beyond its 
power-
supply voltage, VS. For example, the voltage applied to the VS power supply terminal can be 5 V, 
whereas the
load power-supply voltage being monitored (the common-mode voltage) can be as high as 85 V. Note 
that the
device can also withstand the full 0 V to 85 V range at the input terminals, regardless of whether 
the device has
power applied or not. Avoid applications where the GND pin is disconnected while device is actively 
powered.

Place the required power-supply bypass capacitors as close as possible to the supply and ground 
terminals of
the device. A typical value for this supply bypass capacitor is 0.1 µF. Applications with noisy or 
high-impedance
power supplies may require additional decoupling capacitors to reject power-supply noise.

10 Layout

10.1 Layout Guidelines

Connect the input pins (IN+ and IN–) to the sensing resistor using a Kelvin connection or a 4-wire 
connection.
This connection technique ensures that only the current-sensing resistor impedance is sensed 
between the input
pins. Poor routing of the current-sensing resistor commonly results in additional resistance 
present between
the input pins. Given the very low ohmic value of the current-sensing resistor, any additional 
high-current
carrying impedance causes significant measurement errors. Place the power-supply bypass capacitor 
as close
as possible to the supply and ground pins.
