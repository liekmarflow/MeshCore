5 Description (continued)

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

The charger supports the narrow VDC power path management, in which the system is regulated at a 
voltage
slightly higher than the battery voltage without being allowed to drop below the minimum system 
voltage. The
minimum system voltage allows the system to operate even when the battery is completely discharged 
or
removed. When system power exceeds the input source rating, battery supplement mode supports the 
system
power requirement without overloading the input source.

The device charges a battery from a wide range of the input sources including legacy USB adapter to 
high
voltage USB PD adapter and traditional barrel adapter. The charger automatically sets converter to 
be buck,
boost or buck-boost configurations based on input voltage and battery voltage without the host 
control. The
dual input source selector manages the power flowing from two different input sources. The inputs 
selection is
controlled by the host through I2C with default source #1 (VAC1) as the primary input and the 
source #2 (VAC2)
as the secondary input.

To support fast charging using adjustable high voltage adapter, the device provides D+/D- 
handshake. The
device is compliant with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power delivery specification with input current and 
voltage
regulation. In addition, the Input Current Optimizer (ICO) allows the detection of maximum power 
point of an
unknown input source. The BQ25798 also provides a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to
optimize the power drawn when connected to a solar cell.

Besides the I2C host controlled charging mode, this charger also supports autonomous charging mode. 
After
power up, the charging is enabled with default register settings. The device can complete a 
charging cycle
without any software engagements. It detects battery voltage and charges the battery in different 
phases: trickle
charging, pre-charging, constant current (CC) charging and constant voltage (CV) charging. At the 
end of the
charging cycle, the charger automatically terminates when the charge current is below a pre-set 
limit (termination
current) in the constant voltage phase. When the full battery falls below the recharge threshold, 
the charger will
automatically start another charging cycle.

In the absence of input sources, this device supports USB On-the-Go (OTG) function, discharging 
battery to
generate an adjustable 2.8-V to 22-V voltage on VBUS with 10-mV step size, which is compliant to 
the USB PD

3.0 specification defined programmable power supply (PPS) feature. The BQ25798 also provides backup 
mode
to                                                        supply a system load at PMID using the 
adjustable OTG voltage when the adapter is removed.

The charger provides various safety features for battery charging and system operations, including 
battery
temperature negative thermistor monitoring, trickle charge, pre-charge and fast charge timers and 
over-voltage/
overcurrent protections on battery and input. The thermal regulation reduces charge current when 
the junction
temperature exceeds a programmable threshold. The STAT output of the device reports the charging 
status and
any fault conditions. The INT pin immediately notifies host when fault occurs.

It is available in a 29-pin 4mm × 4mm QFN package.

DESCRIPTION

Input FETs Driver Pin 2 – The charge pump output to drive the port #2 input N-channel MOSFET
(ACFET2) and the reverse blocking N-channel MOSFET (RBFET2). The charger turns on the back-to-
back MOSFETs by increasing the ACDRV2 voltage 5V above the common source connection of the
ACFET2 and RBFET2 when the turn-on condition is met. Tie ACDRV2 to GND if no ACFET2 and
RBFET2 installed.

Input FETs Driver Pin 1 – The charge pump output to drive the port #1 input N-channel MOSFET
(ACFET1) and the reverse blocking N-channel MOSFET (RBFET1). The charger turns on the back-to-
back MOSFETs by increasing the ACDRV1 voltage 5V above the common source connection of the
ACFET1 and RBFET1 when the turn-on condition is met. Tie ACDRV1 to GND if no ACFET1 and
RBFET1 installed.

Ship FET Enable or System Power Reset Control Input – When the device is in ship mode or in the
shutdown mode, the SDRV turns off the external ship FET to minimize the battery leakage current. A
logic low on this pin with tSM_EXIT duration turns on ship FET to force the device to exit the ship 
mode.
A logic low on this pin with tRST duration resets system power by turning off the ship FET for 
tRST_SFET
(also setting the charger in HIZ mode when VBUS is high) and then turning on ship FET (also 
disabling
the charger HIZ mode) to provide full system power reset. During tRST_SFET when the ship FET is off,
the charger applies a 30mA discharging current on SYS to discharge system voltage. The pin contains
an internal pull-up through a RQON resistor. The typical output voltage is 3.6 V-3.8 V with VBUS and
VBAT > 5V.

Active Low Charge Enable Pin – Battery charging is enabled when EN_CHG bit is 1 and CE pin is
LOW. CE pin must be pulled HIGH or LOW, do not leave floating.

I2C Interface Clock – Connect SCL to the logic rail through a 10 kΩ resistor.

I2C Interface Data – Connect SDA to the logic rail through a 10 kΩ resistor.

Temperature Qualification Voltage Input – Connect a negative temperature coefficient thermistor.
Program                                        temperature window with a resistor divider from REGN 
to TS to GND. Charge suspends when
TS pin voltage is out of range. Recommend a 103AT-2 10kΩ thermistor.

Input Current Limit Setting and HIZ Mode Control Pin – Program ILIM_HIZ voltage by connecting
a resistor divider from pull up rail to ILIM_HIZ pin to ground. The pin voltage is calculated as: 
VILIM_HIZ

= 1V + 800mΩ × IINDPM, in which IINDPM is the target input current. The input current limit used by
the                                             charger is the lower setting of ILIM_HIZ pin and 
the IINDPM register. When the pin voltage is below
0.75V, the buck-boost converter enters non-switching mode, similar to HiZ mode using EN_HIZ bit, but
with REGN on. When the pin voltage is above 1V, the converter resumes switching. Connect ILIM_HIZ
to REGN to set the maximum input current limit.

Positive Input for Battery Voltage Sensing – Connect to the positive terminal of battery pack. Place
100Ω series resistance between this pin and the battery positive terminal.

Output High Side Power MOSFET Gate Driver Power Supply – Connect a 10V or higher rating,
47nF ceramic capacitor between SW2 and BTST2 as the bootstrap capacitor for driving high side
switching                                      MOSFET (Q4).

Charger POR Default Settings Program – At power up, the charger detects the resistance tied to
PROG pin to determine the default switching frequency and the default battery charging profile. The
surface mount resistor with ±1% or ±2% tolerance is recommended. Please refer to more details in the
section of PROG Pin Configuration.

Open Drain Interrupt Output. – Connect the INT pin to a logic rail via a 10kΩ resistor. The INT pin
sends an active low, 256μs pulse to the host to report the charger device status and faults.

The Battery Charging Power Connection – Connect to the positive terminal of the battery pack.
The internal charging current sensing circuit is connected between SYS and BAT. The recommended
capacitors at BAT are 2 pieces of 10μF ceramic capacitors.

External N-channel Ship FET (SFET) Gate Driver Output – The driver pin of the external ship FET.
The                                              ship FET is always turned on when the ship mode is 
disabled, and it keeps off when the charger
is in ship mode or shutdown mode. Connect a 1nF, 50V rated, 0402 package, ceramic capacitor from
SDRV to GND or SDRV to BAT when the ship FET is not used.

The Charger Output Voltage to System – The internal N-channel high side MOSFET (Q4) is
connected between SYS and SW2 with drain on SYS and source on SW2. The recommended
capacitors  at SYS are 5 pieces of 10μF and one piece of 0.1μF ceramic capacitors. Place the 0.1μF
ceramic capacitor as close as possible to the charger IC.

9 Detailed Description

9.1 Overview

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

The BQ25798 is a fully integrated, switch-mode buck-boost charger for a 1 cell ~ 4 cell Li-ion 
battery and
Li-polymer battery. For compact design and minimum component count, the charger integrates the 4 
switching
MOSFETs (Q₁, Q₂, Q₃, Q₄), input and charging current sensing circuits, the battery FET (BATFET) and 
all
the loop compensation of the buck-boost converter. It provides high power density and design 
flexibility to
charge batteries across the full input voltage range for USB Type-C™ and USB-PD applications such 
as digital
cameras, drones and mobile printers.

The charger supports narrow VDC (NVDC) power path management, in which the system is regulated at a
voltage slightly higher than the battery voltage, without dropping below a configurable minimum 
system voltage.
The system keeps operating even when the battery is completely discharged or removed. When load 
power
exceeds the input source rating, the battery gets into supplement mode and prevents the input 
source from
being overloaded and the system from crashing.

The device charges a battery from a wide range of input sources including legacy USB adapter to 
high voltage
USB-PD adapter and traditional barrel adapter. The charger seamlessly transitions between buck, 
boost and
buck-boost modes based on input voltage and battery voltage without host control. The optional 
dual-input
source selector manages the power flowing from two different input sources, prioritizing the first 
available input
source. The host may manually transition between input sources using I2C.

To support fast charging using adjustable high voltage adapter (HVDCP), the device provides D+/D- 
handshake.
The device is compliant with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power delivery specification with input current 
and voltage
regulation. In addition, the Input Current Optimizer (ICO) allows the detection of maximum power 
point of an
unknown input source. The BQ25798 also features a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to
optimize the energy drawn from a low-power photovoltaic panel. This MPPT algorithm measures the 
open-circuit
voltage of the panel on a user-configurable period, then adjusts the VINDPM using the VOC_PCT 
setting to
calculate                                                      the maximum power point as a 
percentage of the measured open-circuit voltage.

In addition to the I2C host controlled charging mode, BQ25798 also supports autonomous charging 
mode. After
power up, the charging is defaulted enabled with all the registers default settings. The device can 
complete a
charging cycle without any software engagements. It detects battery voltage and charges the battery 
in different
phases: trickle charging, pre-charging, constant current (CC) charging and constant voltage (CV) 
charging. At
the end of the charging cycle, the charger automatically terminates when the charge current is 
below a pre-set
limit (termination current) in the constant voltage phase. When the full battery falls below the 
recharge threshold,
the charger will automatically start another charging cycle.

In the absence of input sources, BQ25798 supports USB On-the-Go (OTG) function, discharging the 
battery to
generate an adjustable 2.8V~22V voltage on VBUS with 10mV step size. This is compliant with the USB 
PD 3.0
specification defined PPS feature. The BQ25798 also supports a backup feature using this same 
mechanism in
which a system load connected at PMID may be supplied with the adjustable OTG voltage when the 
adapter is
removed. Once configured, the integrated backup comparator automatically triggers the converter to 
discharge
the battery, holding up the PMID node and transitioning into backup mode without host intervention.

The charger provides various safety features for battery charging and system operations, including 
battery
temperature negative thermistor (NTC) monitoring, trickle charge, pre-charge and fast charge timers 
and over-
voltage/over-current protections on the battery and the charger power input pin. The thermal 
regulation reduces
charge current when the die temperature exceeds a programmable threshold. The STAT output of the 
device
reports the charging status and any fault conditions. The INT pin immediately notifies the host 
when a fault
occurs.

The device also provides a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for monitoring charge current 
and input/
battery/system voltages, the TS pin voltage and the die temperature. It is available in a 29-pin 
4.0 mm x 4.0 mm
QFN package.

9.3 Feature Description

9.3.1 Device Power-On-Reset

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

The internal bias circuits of the BQ25798 are powered from the higher of either VVBUS or VBAT 
through an
integrated power selector. The valid voltage to power up the device has to be greater than 
VVBUS_UVLOZ when
powering from VBUS or VBAT_UVLOZ when powering from BAT. When VVBUS < VVBUS_UVLOZ, VBAT < VBAT_UVLOZ
and a voltage higher than VAC_PRESENT is present at either VAC1 or VAC2, the device will be powered 
from VAC₁
or VAC₂, depending on which comes first.

9.3.2 PROG Pin Configuration

At POR, the charger detects the PROG pin pull down resistance, then sets the charger default POR 
switching
frequency and the battery cell count. Please follow the resistance list in Table 9-1 to set the 
desired
POR switching frequency and battery cell count. The surface mount resistor with ±1% or ±2% 
tolerance is
recommended.

Table 9-1. PROG Pin Resistance to Set Default Switching Frequency and Battery Cell Count

SWITCHING FREQUENCY         CELL COUNT        TYPICAL RESISTANCE AT PROG PIN

1.5 MHz                 1s                   3.0 kΩ

750 kHz                 1s                   4.7 kΩ

1.5 MHz                 2s                  6.04 kΩ

750 kHz                 2s                   8.2 kΩ

1.5 MHz                 3s                  10.5 kΩ

750 kHz                 3s                  13.7 kΩ

1.5 MHz                 4s                  17.4 kΩ

750 kHz                 4s                  27.0 kΩ

Some of the charging parameters default values are determined by the battery cell count identified 
by PROG pin
configuration, which are summarized in the table below.

Table 9-2. Charging Parameters Dependent on Battery Cell Count

CELL (REG0x0A[7:6])          1s           2s           3s           4s

ICHG (REG0x03/04)           1A          1 A          1 A          1 A

VSYSMIN (REG0x00[5:0])         3.5 V          7 V          9 V          12 V

VREG (REG0x01/02)          4.2 V         8.4 V         12.6 V         16.8 V

VREG Range          3 V - 4.99 V      5 V - 9.99 V      10 V - 13.99 V     14 V - 18.8 V

After POR, the host can program the ICHG and VSYSMIN registers to any values within the ranges 
defined in
the register tables. However, when programming the battery charging voltage (VREG), the host must 
ensure the
VREG value is in the allowed range associated with the CELL register (REG0x0A[7:6]) setting defined 
in the
table above. When the CELL register is changed, the ICHG, VSYSMIN and VREG registers are reset to 
the
POR default values associated with the CELL setting.

For example, if the PROG pin resistance is a 2s battery configuration, the default POR CELL, ICHG, 
VSYSMIN
and VREG settings will be 2s, 1 A, 7 V and 8.4 V respectively. After POR, the host can change ICHG 
and
VSYSMIN to any values, and can change VREG to any value between 5V and 9.99V. Assuming that the CELL
bits remain at the 2s battery configuration, then when the REG_RST bit is set or the watchdog timer 
expires, the
registers are reset to default values with ICHG, VSYSMIN and VREG automatically returing to 1 A, 7V 
and 8.4V
respectively.

When the CELL register is 2s battery configuration, any write out of the range of VREG (5 V - 9.99 
V) is ignored
by the charger. If VREG needs to be programmed out of the 5 V - 9.9 V range, such as 11 V, the CELL 
bits have
to be changed to the 3s setting. Setting the CELL bits will also cause the ICHG, VSYSMIN and VREG 
registers
to reset to their 3s POR default values of 1 A, 9 V and 12.6 V. Then the host can program VREG in 
the range of

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023                                         www.ti.com

10 V - 13.99 V. If, after changing the CELL bits to 3S, the REG_RST bit is set or the watchdog 
timer expires, the
ICHG, VSYSMIN and VREG will then be reset to 1 A, 9 V and 12.6 V, regardless of the state of the 
PROG pin.

9.3.3 Device Power Up from Battery without Input Source

If only battery is present and the voltage is above UVLO threshold (VBAT_UVLOZ), the BATFET turns 
on and
connects the battery to the system. The REGN LDO stays off to minimize the quiescent current. The 
low RDS₍ON₎
of BATFET and the low quiescent current on BAT minimize the conduction loss and maximize the 
battery run
time.

The POR sequence when the charger is powered from VBAT is described as below:

1.  5 ms (typical) after VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ, the charger starts ACFET-RBFET detection, reads the 
resistance at
the PROG pin, and then configures the charger POR register set accordingly.

2.  20 ms (typical) after VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ, the I2C registers become accessible to the host..

3. The charger turns the battery FET on to allow the battery to power the system.

9.3.4 Device Power Up from Input Source

When an input source is present at VBUS, the device checks the input source voltage to turn on REGN 
LDO
and all the bias circuits. It detects and sets the input current limit before the buck-boost 
converter is started. The
power up sequence from input source is as listed below:

1.  The device begins the POR sequence when VVBUS > VVBUS_UVLOZ if there is a direct path from 
input to
VBUS, or otherwise when VAC₁ or VAC₂ > VAC_PRESENT.

2. 5 ms (typical) after a valid voltage is first present at either VBUS or VAC1/VAC2 pins, the 
charger starts

the ACFET-RBFET detection, reads the resistance at PROG pin, and then configures the charger power 
on
reset (POR) default register settings accordingly.

3. If ACFET-RBFET are detected on the input source pathway, the corresponding ACDRV turns on the 
pair.

4. 20 ms (typical) after valid voltage voltage presence, the I2C registers become accessible to the 
host.

5.  As soon as VVBUS > VVBUS_UVLOZ (in step 1 or after step 3), VBUS_PRESENT_STAT is set to 1. 150 
ms
(typical) later, REGN is turned on.

6. Once REGN is on, the charger starts the poor source detection. After a good input source is 
detected
(typically 30 ms if there is no retry), PG_STAT is set to 1, then the ADC reads the ILIM_HIZ pin 
voltage and
VBUS voltage and updates the IINDPM and VINDPM registers accordingly.

7. When the poor source detection completes, the charger performs D+/D- detection and updates the
VBUS_STAT and IINDPM registers accordingly.

8. 30 ms (typical) after the D+/D- detection completes, the converter starts switching to power SYS 
and charge
the battery.

9.3.4.1 Power Up REGN LDO

When the device is powered up from VBUS, the LDO is turned on when VVBUS_PRESENT < VBUS < VVBUS_OVP.
When the device is powered up from battery only condition, the LDO is turned on at either one of 
the following
conditions:

• The charger is operated in the OTG mode

•  VBAT is higher than 3.2V, and ADC TS channel is on (ADC_EN = 1 and TS_ADC_DIS = 0)

The REGN LDO supplies internal bias circuits and the MOSFETs gate drivers. The pull-up rails of 
ILIM_HIZ, TS,
and STAT can be connected to REGN. The INT pin pull-up rail is recommended to be an external 1.8V 
or 3.3V
voltage source, rather than REGN, because at battery only condition, the REGN might not be 
available. Except
the charger related pull up rails, the REGN is not recommended to source any other external 
circuit. The REGN
has to power the internal MOSFETs gate drivers, which is very critical for the charger normal 
operation.

9.3.4.2 Poor Source Qualification

After the REGN LDO powers up, the device checks the current capability of the input source. The 
input source
has to meet the following requirements in order to move forward to the next power on steps.

1. VBUS voltage below VVBUS_OVP

2.  VBUS voltage above VPOORSRC when pulling IPOORSRC (typical 10 mA)

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

Once the conditions are met, the status register bit PG_STAT is set high and the INT pin is pulsed 
to signal the
host.

If VBUS_OVP is detected (failing condition 1 above), an INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if 
the
VBUS_OVP_MASK = 0 or the PG_MASK = 0. The VBUS_OVP_STAT and VBUS_OV_FLAG fault registers
get set, and the PG_STAT bit remains low. The device automatically retries input source 
qualification once the
over-voltage fault goes away.

If a poor source is detected (when pulling IPOORSRC, the VBUS voltage drops below VPOORSRC), the 
EN_HIZ bit
is set to 1, PG_STAT bit remains low, PG_FLAG will be set to 1, and an INT pulse will be asserted 
if PG_MASK

= 0. The device will repeat the poor source qualification routine every 7 minutes until either the 
adapter is
removed or the source is qualified. Each failed poor source qualification will cause EN_HIZ and 
PG_FLAG to
be set to 1, and an INT pulse will be asserted if PG_MASK = 0. In the 7 minute interim between poor 
source
qualification attempts, the host may set EN_HIZ = 0 to force an immediate retry of the poor source 
qualification.
The EN_HIZ bit is cleared automatically when the adapter is plugged in, so cycling the adapter will 
also force an
immediate retry of the poor source qualification.

9.3.4.3 ILIM_HIZ Pin

At POR, before the charger converter starts switching, the charger ADC reads the ILIM_HIZ pin 
voltage, and
calculates the input current limit (ILIM) set by this ILIM_HIZ pin, according to:

VILIM_HIZ = 1V + 800 mΩ × ILIM                                          (1)

The ILIM_HIZ pin sets a high clamp for the IINDPM register. If the IINDPM setting from the D+/D- 
detection or
the POR default 3A IINDPM setting is higher than the ILIM clamp, the IINDPM register stays at this 
ILIM clamp.
In addition, the host cannot program the IINDPM register to any values higher than this ILIM clamp 
after POR,
unless the register bit EN_EXTILIM is set to 0.

The ILIM_HIZ pin can be biased from a resistor voltage divider tied to either REGN or another 
external voltage
source. For both the forward charging mode and the OTG mode, when the ILIM_HIZ pin is pulled lower 
than
0.75V, the charger stops switching and REGN stays on. The charger resumes switching if the ILIM_HIZ 
pin
voltage becomes higher than 1V.

If the ADC reads the ILIM_HIZ pin voltage is lower than 1.08V (1V + 800 mΩ × 100 mA), the charger 
considers
the                                                        ILIM clamp to be 100mA, which is the 
minimal setting of the IINDPM register.

9.3.4.4 Default VINDPM Setting

In the POR sequence, right after the D+/D- detection, the charger initiates an ADC reading on the 
VBUS pin
voltage without any load current (VBUS at no load condition, VBUS₀) before the converter starts 
switching. The
default VINDPM threshold is set to be VBUS₀ - 1.4 V (VBUS₀ >= 7 V) or VBUS₀ - 0.7V (VBUS₀ < 7 V).

The VBUS₀ can be remeasured at any time by setting the register bit FORCE_VINDPM_DET=1. The 
converter
stops switching, the ADC measures the VBUS voltage, the VINDPM register field is updated, and then 
the
FORCE_VINDPM_DET bit returns to 0. The force VINDPM detection only can be done when VSYS_STAT

= 0 (VBAT > VSYSMIN), otherwise stopping the converter would cause VSYS to drop below VSYSMIN. If
VSYS_STAT = 1 (VBAT < VSYSMIN), VBUS₀ measurement does not start, the FORCE_VINDPM_DET bit
resets to 0 and the VINDPM register retains its current value. The host must ensure there is a 
battery present
prior to setting FORCE_VINDPDM_DET = 1, or to allow system to be supported by the battery during 
detection.

When the measured VBUS₀ is out of the VINDPM register range, the changer sets the VINDPM register 
to the
minimum value (3.6V) or maximum (22V) value as appropriate.

9.3.4.5 Input Source Type Detection

After the input source is qualified, the charger runs Input Source Type Detection if AUTO_INDET_EN 
bit is set
(default enabled).

The charger follows the USB Battery Charging Specification 1.2 (BC1.2) to detect SDP/CDP/DCP/HVDC
input sources and the non-standard adapters through the USB D+/D- lines. After BC1.2 detection is
completed, the BC1.2_DONE_STAT bit is set to 1, and an INT pulse and BC1.2_DONE_FLAG are asserted

if BC1.2_DONE_MASK = 0. In addition, when USB DCP is detected, the charger initiates adjustable 
high voltage
adapter handshake on D+/D- if HVDCP detection is enabled by the host. The input type might be 
changed after
HVDCP detection is completed.

After input source type detection, the following registers are changed:

1. Input Current Limit (IINDPM) register is changed to set current limit

2. VBUS_STAT bits change to reflect the detected source

After detection is completed, the host can over-write IINDPM registers to change the input current 
limit if
necessary. The charger input current is limited by the lower of IINDPM register or ILIM_HIZ pin 
(when
EN_EXTILIM = 1) regardless of Input Current Optimizer (ICO) setting. When AUTO_INDET_EN is disabled,
the Input Source Type Detection is bypassed, and the Input Current Limit (IINDPM) register remains 
unchanged
from its previous value.

9.3.4.5.1 D+/D– Detection Sets Input Current Limit

The device contains a D+/D- based input source detection to set the input current limit. The D+/D- 
detection has
four major steps: Data Contact Detect (DCD), Primary Detection, Secondary Detection and High 
Voltage DCP
(HVDCP) detection.

The D+/D- Primary Detection includes standard USB BC1.2 and non-standard adapters. When an input 
source
is plugged in, the device starts standard USB BC1.2 detection first. The USB BC1.2 is capable of 
identifying
Standard Downstream Port (SDP), Charging Downstream Port (CDP) and Dedicated Charging Port (DCP). 
The
non-standard detection is used to distinguish vendor specific adapters based on the unique dividers 
they apply
to                                                        the D+/D- pins. The secondary detection 
is used to distinguish two types of charging ports, CDP and DCP.

A CDP usually requires the attached device to send back an enumeration within 2.5 seconds of CDP 
plug-in.
Otherwise, the port will power cycle back to SDP even the D+/D- detection indicates CDP. This 
enumeration
must be handled externally to the charger.

When a Dedicated Charging Port (DCP) is detected, the charger initiates two high voltage adapter 
(HVDCP)
handshakes to enable the corresponding adapter to output a higher voltage for fast charging. The 
HVDCP
detection can be enabled by setting EN_HVDCP=1 and then setting either EN_9V=1 to increase the input
voltage to 9V or EN_12V=1 to increase the input voltage to 12V. When EN_12V and EN_9V are both set 
to 1,
the charger starts 12V first.

9.3.4.5.2 HVDCP Detection Procedure

Figure 9-1 shows that an HVDCP source is first qualified as a DCP source in the USB BC1.2 standard 
detection
stage, then qualified in the following HVDCP detection stage as an HVDCP source. When the HVDCP is 
first
qualified as a DCP, the charger sets an IINDPM limit of 3.25A. The IIDPM is then updated to the 
HVDCP limit of

1.5A after the HVDCP handshake completes. In some cases the higher IINDPM limit of 3.25A may 
interfere with
the source's ability to transition to 9V or 12V if the transition is attemped before the IINDPM is 
updated to 1.5A.

The recommended procedure for enabling detection of HVDCP sources is completed in the following 
steps:

•  Before adapter insertion, the charger is configured with AUTO_INDET_EN = 1 and HVDCP_EN = 0. 
EN_12V
and EN_9V are set as desired for the system.

• When an adapter is inserted, it will be detected as SDP, CDP, DCP or a Non-Standard adapter and 
an I2C

interrupt is sent to the host. If any detection other than DCP is made, the host proceeds as usual.

•  If the adapter is detected as DCP (VBUS_STAT[3:0] = 0011), the host first changes the Input 
Current Limit
register to 1.5A and then changes HVDCP_EN = 1.

•  After HVDCP detection is complete, the host sets HVDCP_EN = 0 to disable HVDCP support in 
preparation
for                                                      the next input source detection sequence.

9.3.4.5.3 Connector Fault Detection

The host can apply different status on D+ pin including HIZ, 0V, 0.6V, 1.2V, 2.0V, 2.7V, 3.3V or 
"short to D-", and
different status on D- pin including HIZ, 0.6V, 1.2V, 2.0V, 2.7V or 3.3V. The device also provides 
ADC readings of
the D+ and D- pin voltages. The host can use the information to determine if connector is normal or 
in any faults.
The voltage values are set using the DPLUS_DAC and DMINUS_DAC register. The D+/D- pins are only 
applied
at the VAC1 input source. If the DPLUS_DAC or DMINUS_DAC are programmed when the adapter is plugged 
in
and the D+/D- detection is in process, the device will ignore the register programming.

9.3.5 Dual-Input Power Mux

The BQ25798 has two ACDRV drivers to control two optional sets of back-to-back power N-FETs, 
selecting
and managing the power from two different input sources. In the POR sequence, the charger detects 
whether
the ACFETs-RBFETs are present, then updates the ACRB1_STAT or ACRB2_STAT status bits accordingly.
The ACFET1-RBFET1 or ACFET2-RBFET2 can be controlled by setting the register bit EN_ACDRV1 or
EN_ACDRV2. If the external ACFET-RBFET is not present, then tie VAC1 / VAC2 to VBUS and connect
ACDRV1 / ACDRV2 to GND. The power MUX drivers support three different application cases, which are
elaborated below.

9.3.5.1 ACDRV Turn On Condition

The ACDRV1 and ACDRV2 control the input power MUX. In order to turn on either ACDRV1 or ACDRV2, all 
of
the following conditions must be valid:

1. The corresponding ACFET-RBFET was detected at power on: ACDRV is not short to ground.

At POR, the charger detects that no ACFETs or RBFETs are present by sensing that the ACDRV1 and 
ACDRV2
pins are both shorted to GND and configures power mux register fields as shown in Table 9-5.

is pulled down to GND. This structure is illustrated in Figure 9-3, which is able to support either 
single
input (one from VAC1 to VBUS through ACFET1-RBFET1) or dual-input (one from VAC1 to VBUS through

When a valid input is presented at VAC1, the charger will set EN_ACDRV1 = 1 and turn ACFET1-RBFET1
on. To swap from the input at VAC1 to the input at VBUS, the host has to turn off the ACFET1-RBFET1 
first
by setting DIS_ACDRV=1 (forcing EN_ACDRV1 = 0), then enable the other input source which is 
connected
directly to VBUS. To swap from the input at VBUS to the input at VAC1, the host has to disable the 
input source
connected to VBUS, wait for VBUS to fall below VBUS_PRESENT, then turn on the ACFET1-RBFET1 by 
setting
DIS_ACDRV                                                      = 0.

is developed to support dual-input connected at VAC1 and VAC2. At POR, the charger detects both

In dual input mode, the ACDRV automatically turns on the ACFET-RBFET of the path where a valid input
is first presented, without host intervention.If the two inputs are presented at VAC1 and VAC2 
exactly at the
same time, ACFET1-RBFET1 with higher priority (port #1 is primary) is turned on while ACFET2-RBFET2 
stays
off (port #2 is secondary). EN_ACDRV1 is automatically set to 1. If a valid input is presented on 
the second
path while the first path is already on with a valid input, the ACFET-RBFET of the second path 
remains off. If
desired, the host may manually perform a switch between power paths by switching the values of 
EN_ACDRV1
and EN_ACDRV2. Both EN_ACDRV bits may be updated in a single I2C write operation to minimize the
transition time. Note that programming EN_ACDRV1 = 1, EN_ACDRV2 = 1 at the same time to turn on both
ACFET1-RBFET1 and ACFET2-RBFET2 is not allowed, and will be ignored by the charger.

To transition from one input to the other, the device first turns off the initially active 
ACFET-RBFET pair, waits
until the VBUS voltage drops lower than VBUS_PRESENT, and then enables the new ACFET-RBFET pair. 
During
this                                                      change over, the converter stops 
switching for a short period of time.

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

If two valid voltages are present at VAC1 and VAC2 and the source on the connected path becomes 
invalid
because of VAC_UVLO, VAC_OV or IBUS_OC, the charger automatically swaps the input without any host
engagement. Any time that the converter autonomously swaps the source paths, it will also update the
EN_ACDRV1 and EN_ACDRV2 bits accordingly in order to indicate the active power path.

With only one valid input presented at either VAC1 or VAC2, the ACFET1-RBFET1 and ACFET2-RBFET2 can
not be both turned off by setting REG0x13[7:6] = 00. Instead, the host should set DIS_ACDRV = 1 to 
force
both ACFET-RBFET pairs off. With input sources present at both VAC1 and VAC2, the host can turn off 
the two
ACFET-RBFET pairs by setting either REG0x13[7:6] = 00 or DIS_ACDRV = 1.

9.3.6 Buck-Boost Converter Operation

The charger employs a synchronous buck-boost converter that allows charging the 1s to 4s battery 
from a
legacy 5V USB input source, HVDCP and USB-PD power sources. The converter operates uninterruptedly 
and
continuously in buck, boost or buck-boost mode depending on the input to system output voltage 
difference.
When the input voltage is close to the system output voltage, the converter operates in a 
proprietary buck-boost
mode.

With a battery attached at BAT and input power at VBUS, the charger can provide at least the MINSYS 
voltage
at SYS and charge current for the battery at BAT. Once the battery voltage reaches the MINSYS 
voltage, the
SYS voltage follows the BAT voltage up. With no battery attached to BAT and input power at VBUS, 
the voltages
at SYS and BAT vary depending on the whether or not charge is enabled as explained below.

1.  No battery or battery removed and charge disabled by CE pin or EN_CHG register or thermistor 
removed
from                                                     TS pin - The charger keeps the BAT pin 
voltage at low-level, steady-state voltage and regulates SYS
pin to MINSYS. The host can monitor the ADC BAT pin voltage and TS fault register to determine when 
a
valid battery is attached.

2.  No battery or battery removed while charge enabled and TS pin function is disabled - The charger
continuously                                                      tries to charge the BAT 
capacitance, typically resulting in the BAT voltage alternating between
a low level and BATOVP fault. The SYS voltage follows the battery voltage up, potentially reaching 
SYSOVP
fault. In order to determine if a battery is attached, the host must periodically disable charge, 
force IBAT
discharge current and then read the ADC BAT pin voltage. Alternatively, the host can monitor the 
INT pin for
rapid interrupts and then read the charge status bits for fast (<1 s for typical BAT pin 
capacitance) toggling
between charging, taper and termination.

9.3.6.1 Force Input Current Limit Detection

In host mode, the host can force the device to run Input Current Limit Detection by setting 
FORCE_INDET
bit to 1. After the detection is completed, FORCE_INDET bit automatically returns to 0. After the 
detection is
completed, the input REG06_Input_Current_Limit (IINDPM), and the VBUS_STAT bits may be changed by 
the
device according to the detection result.

9.3.6.2 Input Current Optimizer (ICO)

The device provides Input Current Optimizer (ICO) to identify maximum power point in order to avoid 
overloading
the input source. The algorithm automatically identifies maximum input current limit of an unknown 
power source
and sets the charger IINDPM register properly, in order to prevent from entering the charger input 
voltage
(VINDPM) regulation. This feature is disabled by default at POR (EN_ICO = 0) and only activates 
when EN_ICO
bit                                                         is set to 1.

After DCP type input source is detected based on the procedures described in Section 9.3.4.5, the 
algorithm
runs automatically if EN_ICO bit is set. The algorithm can also be forced to execute by setting 
FORCE_ICO bit
regardless of input source type detected. Please note that EN_ICO = 1 is required for FORCE_ICO to 
work.

The actual input current limit used by the Dynamic Power Management is reported in the ICO_ILIM 
register
whether set by ICO if enabled or IINDPM register if not. In addition, the current limit is clamped 
by the ILIM_HIZ
pin unless EN_EXT_ILIM bit is 0 to disable the ILIM_HIZ pin function.

When V(BAT) > VMINSYS, the ICO algorithm starts with the maximum allowed input current as reported 
in
ICO_ILIM register as 500 mA then continually increases this limit until the optimal limit is found. 
When VBAT <
VSYSMIN, the battery voltage can be too low to supplement a large system load if the charger buck 
converter

is limited to 500 mA and then ramped up by the ICO algorithm. Therefore, when a VBAT < VSYSMIN, the
ICO algorithm starts with the maximum allowed input current as reported in ICO_ILIM register to the 
input
current-limit register value in REG0x06 and then continually decreses this limit until the optimal 
limit is found.

Once the optimal input current is identified, the ICO_STAT[1:0] and ICO_FLAG bits are set. The 
actual input
current is reported in the ICO_ILIM register and does not change unless the algorithm is triggered 
again by the
following events :

1. A new input source is plugged-in, or EN_HIZ bit is toggled

2. IINDPM register is changed

3. VINDPM register is changed

4. FORCE_ICO bit is set to 1

5. VBUS_OVP event

These events also reset the ICO_STAT[1:0] bits to 01

9.3.6.3 Maximum Power Point Tracking for Small PV Panel

The device implements a simple algorithm to track the maximum power point (MPP) when the input 
source is a
solar panel. The I-V and P-V curves of a solar panel are most strongly dependent on irradiation and 
temperature.
The MPP is most commonly located between 70%~90% of the Open Circuit Voltage (VOC) of the solar 
panel.
The algorithm automatically and periodically detects the charger input source VOC, and sets the 
VINDPM to be
a ratio of the measured VOC. It is recommended to set the charging current to the maximum value, so 
that the
VINDPM is always triggered and activated. The MPPT algorithm is disabled by default at POR (EN_MPPT 
= 0).
The algorithm runs automatically when EN_MPPT bit is set to 1.

Similar to the FORCE_VINDPM_DET feature, when the battery voltage is lower than VSYSMIN (VSYS_STAT

= 1), the MPPT algorithm can not be enabled. The EN_MPPT bit will be reset back to 0 if it is 
written to

1. In the MPPT process, the buck-boost charger stops switching and keeps in the non-switching 
status for a
time period programmed by VOC_DLY[1:0]. When the charger stops switching, the system is powered by 
the
battery discharging. Then the charger measures the open-circuit voltage of the input soruce 
attached at VBUS
and updates the VINDPM to be VOC_PCT[2:0]*VOC. The converter starts up again for the VOC_RATE[1:0]
time interval, stops switching for another VOC_DLY[1:0], measures VOC, and updates the VINDPM 
register to
complete the next cycle. When VBUS goes below VBUS_PRESENT, the EN_MPPT bit will be reset to 0, and 
forced
to be 0 even if the host writes it to 1.

For the EN_ICO, FORCE_VINDPM_DET and EN_MPPT three register bits, only one of them can be set to 1 
at
a given time. If one of them is enabled, the charger will block the host from enabling the other 
two features until
the first is disabled.

9.3.6.4 Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM)

In order to improve converter light-load efficiency, the device switches to PFM control at light 
load condition.
The effective switching frequency decreases accordingly as load current decreases. The PFM 
operation can be
disabled by setting PFM_FWD_DIS = 1. With PFM disabled, the converter stays at the PWM mode 
switching
frequency and transitions into DCM operation at light load condition. The minimum effective 
switching frequency
in  PFM can be limited to 25 kHz to eliminate the audible noise concern if the out of audio (OOA) 
feature is
enabled by setting DIS_FWD_OOA = 0. The host can disable the OOA by setting DIS_FWD_OOA = 1, which
may result in the converter effective switching frequency dropping below 25 kHz at extremely light 
load. The
PFM operation of OTG mode can be independently controlled using the PFM_OTG_DIS and DIS_OTG_OOA
bits. In PFM mode, the converter limits peak inductor current to 2 A, when OOA is enabled, and 3.3 
A if OOA is
disabled or if the load has increased close to the point of exiting PFM.

9.3.6.5 Device HIZ State

The charger enters HIZ mode when EN_HIZ bit is set to 1. The HIZ mode refers to a charger state, in 
which the
REGN LDO is off, and the converter stops switching even if the adapter is present. Similar to the 
battery only
condition, the charger is in a low quiescent current mode, turns off the ADC and turns on the 
BATFET to support
the system load. The ADC can be re-enabled during HIZ by setting EN_ADC =1.

Some of the faults, such as VBUS_OVP, VSYS_OVP, VBAT_OVP and OTG_OVP, force the converter to stop
switching but keep the REGN and other internal circuits powered on. Alternatively, some of the 
faults, like
VSYS_SHORT and IBUS_OCP, force the charger into HIZ mode by setting EN_HIZ=1. More details could be
found in the Section 9.3.13.

9.3.7 USB On-The-Go (OTG)

9.3.7.1 OTG Mode to Power External Devices

The device supports the OTG operation to deliver power from the battery to other external devices 
through the
USB ports. The OTG voltage regulation is set in VOTG[10:0] register bits. The OTG current 
regulation is set in
IOTG[6:0] register bits. To enable the OTG operation, the following conditions have to be valid:

•  The battery voltage is higher than VBAT_OTG rising threshold, and not trigger the VBAT_OVP 
protection.

•  The VBUS is below VVBUS_UVLO.

•  The voltage at TS pin is within the range configured by BHOT and BCOLD register bits

The population of ACFET1-RBFET1 and ACFET2-RBFET2 as detected at POR affects the operation of the
converter in OTG mode as summarized in Table 9-8.

X           X           1      Converter starts 5 ms after EN_OTG = 1

For swapping the OTG output from port 1 to port 2, assuming EN_ACDRV2 is already 0, the host has to 
set
EN_ACDRV1 = 0 to turn off ACFET1_RBFET1 first, which causes the converter to stop switching and 
VBUS to
drop below VBUS_PRESENT. The host then sets EN_ACDRV2 = 1, and the converter starts switching again 
and
ACDRV2 turns on ACFET2-RBFET2, which allows VBUS to ramp up. The similar procedure can be applied to
the case of swapping the OTG output from port 2 to port 1.

In OTG mode, the converter PFM operation can be disabled by setting PFM_OTG_DIS = 1 and the OOA can 
be
disabled by setting DIS_OTG_OOA = 1.

The simplified application diagram for the OTG mode operation is shown in Figure 9-5, in which the 
power flow is

The charger regulates the battery discharging current in OTG mode. When IBAT rises higher than the
IBAT_REG[1:0] register setting, the charger reduces the OTG output current and prioritizes the 
system
load current if there is any. The IBAT_REG_STAT bit is set to 1 and an INT pulse is asserted, and if
IBAT_REG_MASK = 0, the IBAT_REG_FLAG is set to 1. If the OTG output current is decreased to zero 
and the
system load pulls even more current, the charger can no longer limit the battery discharging 
current.

When IBAT_REG[1:0] is set to 00, 01 or 10 (3A, 4A or 5A), there is a soft-start applied to the OTG 
ouput current.

soft-start is applied.

9.3.7.2 Backup Power Supply Mode

By utilizing the charger bidirectional buck-boost operation, BQ25798 supports the backup power 
supply mode. In
this mode, the charger discharges the energy stored in the battery or the capacitors to hold the 
VBUS voltage for
certain amount of time after the adapter is disconnected. The backup mode only can be enabled when 
VBUS is
high, by setting EN_BACKUP = 1. When VBUS becomes low, the charger resets EN_BACKUP bit to 0.

A comparator is monitoring the VBUS voltage. Once the adapter is disconnected, and the VBUS drops 
lower
than the pre-set threshold, the charger terminates the forward charging mode, forces EN_OTG = 1, 
starts
discharging the battery or supercapacitor to regulate the VBUS voltage at the VOTG register 
setting. After
the charger enters the backup mode, the VBUS_STAT[3:0] is changed to “In the backup OTG mode” status
(VBUS_STAT[3:0] = 1100). At the same time, an INT pulse is asserted and the VBUS_FLAG is set to 1, 
if
VBUS_MASK = 0.

The  comparator  thresholds  monitoring  VBUS  to  trigger  backup  mode  are  programmed  in  the
VBUS_BACKUP[1:0] register bits, as a ratio of VINDPM values. The host is not able to write EN_OTG = 
1
when VBUS is high. Only when EN_BACKUP = 1 and VBUS drops lower than the threshold, the charger 
itself
forces EN_OTG = 1 to enter the backup mode.

The ACFET1-RBFET1 is required for the backup mode operation. Once the backup mode is triggered, the
charger turns off the ACFET1-REFET1 by setting DIS_ACDRV = 1, to avoid back driving the adapter in 
the
event when the adapter is still physically connected at VAC1. The ACFET1-RBFET1 also provides the 
charger
input over-voltage (VAC_OVP) protection. When the input voltage is higher than the programmable 
VAC_OVP
threshold (VAC_OVP[1:0]), the charger turns off the ACFET1-RBFET1, changes from forward charging 
mode to
backup mode. If there is no ACFET1-RBFET1 detected at POR, the charger blocks backup mode from being
enabled by forcing EN_BACKUP = 0.

If the charger is running in backup mode, either of the two conditions listed below can force the 
charger to exit
the backup operation:

•  When the battery or the capacitors voltage is discharged lower than VBAT_OTGZ

• The host sets the EN_OTG bit from 1 to 0

If there is an adapter reconnected while the charger is in backup mode, the user may transition the 
source which
powers the PMID load from the battery back to the adapter. The following sequence is used to switch 
from the
battery power back to ACIN1 while simultaneously re-arming the backup mode:

1.  Write BKUP_ACFET1_ON (REG0x16[0]) register bit to 1. Setting BKUP_ACFET1 _ON = 1 will cause the
device to set DIS_ACDRV = 0 and EN_ACDRV1 = 1. After that, backup mode is disabled, however, the
charger remains in the normal OTG mode. The ACFET1-RBFET1 is turned on to connect the adapter to
VBUS. The user must ensure the adapter voltage is equal to or higher than the charger VOTG voltage
setting, otherwise, the charger OTG output might back drive the adapter connected to VBUS.

2. Determine the source at ACIN1 is valid (is not in overvoltage and did not fail poor source 
detection) by
reading back EN_ACDRV1 as 1.

3.  Set EN_OTG = 0, in order to exit OTG mode and enter the forward charging mode without PMID 
voltage
crash.                                                  Setting BKUP_ACFET1_ON = 1, also clears 
BKUP_ACFET1_ON to 0 and sets EN_BACKUP to 1.

In a normal adapter attach sequence, the poor source detection is run, the ILIM pin is measured to 
set IINDPM
and the VBUS is measured to set the VINDPM. In order to complete step 3 in the above sequence to 
re-arm
the backup mode without allowing the power stage to be turned off, this sequence is skipped. This 
allows
the converter to quickly transition back into backup mode if the adapter is unexpectedly removed 
during the
sequence. This only occurs when EN_OTG is set to 0 while BKUP_ACFET1_ON = 1. If BKUP_ACFET1_ON

= 0, or EN_OTG is already 0 when the adapter is attached, the charger powers up normally. It is 
generally
recommended to allow 5 seconds of settling time before attempting to re-arm backup mode.

Because VBUS is not measured during the re-arming sequence, the VINDPM is not updated. In most
applications, the device is expected to support a single adapter so that the previously-set VINDPM 
value is
still accurate. For those applications where different adapter voltages are possible, the user can 
manually set the

VINDPM value by measuring VBUS with the ADC before initiating the re-arming sequence, scaling the 
value and

crash.                                                     Since BKUP_ACFET1_ON is 0, EN_BCKUP will 
remain at 0.

9.3.8 Power Path Management

The device accommodates a wide range of input voltage range from 3.6V to 24V covering the legacy 5V 
USB
input, HVDCP, USB-PD input and the wall adapter. The device provides automatic power path selection 
to
supply the system (SYS) from input source (VBUS), battery (BAT) or both.

9.3.8.1 Narrow VDC Architecture

The device deploys Narrow VDC architecture (NVDC) with BATFET separating system from battery. The
minimum system voltage is set by VSYSMIN bits. Even with a fully depleted battery, the system is 
regulated
above the minimum system voltage. The default minimum system voltage at POR is determined according 
to the
PROG pin configuration resistor.

The NVDC architecture also provides charging termination when the battery is fully charged. By 
turning off the
BATFET, the adapter power is prioritized to support the system, which avoids having the battery 
continuously
charged and discharged by the system load even if the adapter is present. This is important for 
extending the
battery life time.

When the battery voltage is below the minimum system voltage setting, the BATFET operates in linear 
mode
(LDO mode), and the system is regulated at around 200 mV above the minimum system voltage setting. 
As
the battery voltage rises above the minimum system voltage, the BATFET is fully on and the voltage 
difference
between the system and battery is the RDS₍ON₎ of the BATFET multiplied by the charging current. 
When battery
charging is disabled and VBAT is above the minimum system voltage setting or charging is 
terminated, the
system is always regulated at 200mV (typical, PWM switching) or 600mV (typical, PFM switching) above
battery voltage. The status register VSYS_STAT bit goes high when the system is in minimum system 
voltage
regulation.

9.3.8.2 Dynamic Power Management

To use the maximum available current from the input power source without over loading the adapter, 
the
BQ25798 features Dynamic Power Management (DPM), which continuously monitors the input current and 
input
voltage. When the input power at the VBUS pin is too low to support the load from SYS pin and the 
battery
charge current from BAT pin, the charger engages either IINDPM to limit its current or VINDPM to 
prevent further
reduction in VBUS pin voltage.

When the system voltage is regulated at VSYSMIN and SYS voltage temporarily drops lower than 
VSYSMIN,
the VSYSMIN loop reduces charging current so that the SYS voltage remains at the VSYSMIN level. If 
the
charge current falls to zero, but the input source is still overloaded, the SYS voltage will drop. 
Once the SYS
voltage falls below the battery voltage, the device automatically enters supplement mode in which 
the BATFET
turns on. The battery starts discharging so that the system is supported from both the input source 
and battery.
The battery FET operates in ideal diode mode, driving the battery FET gate voltage to regulate the 
BATFET VDS
at 25 mV for low current. This prevents SYS voltage oscillations from entering and exiting the 
supplement mode.
As the discharge current increases, the ideal diode loop drives the BATFET gate to a higher 
voltage, in order to
reduce                                                        the battery FET RDS₍ON₎ until the 
BATFET is fully turned on. Once the BATFET is fully on, the VDS linearly
increases with the discharge current. Figure 9-8 shows the V-I curve of the BATFET ideal diode 
operation. The
BATFET turns off to exit supplement mode when the battery is below battery depletion threshold.

9.3.9 Battery Charging Management

BQ25798 charges 1S~4S Li-Ion batteries with up to 5A charge current for high capacity cells. The 
battery
charging in different stages is controlled by the integrated BATFET. The low RDS₍ON₎ BATFET 
improves charging
efficiency and minimizes the voltage drop during discharging.

9.3.9.1 Autonomous Charging Cycle

When battery charging is enabled (EN_CHG bit =1 and CE pin is LOW), the device autonomously 
completes
a charging cycle without host involvement. The device default charging parameters are listed in 
Table 9-9.
The host can always control the charging operation and optimize the charging parameters by writing 
to the
corresponding registers through I2C.

• No thermistor fault on TS pin

• No safety timer fault

The charger automatically terminates the charging cycle when the charging current is below 
termination
threshold, charge voltage is above recharge threshold, and the device is not in DPM mode or thermal
regulation. When a fully charged battery voltage is discharged below recharge threshold (threshold 
selectable
via VRECHG[1:0] bits), the device automatically starts a new charging cycle. After the charging 
terminates,
toggling either CE pin or EN_CHG bit initiates a new charging cycle.

The STAT output indicates the charging status of: charging (LOW), charging complete or charging 
disabled
(HIGH) or charging fault (Blinking). The STAT output can be disabled by setting DIS_STAT = 1. In 
addition, the
status register (CHG_STAT) indicates the different charging phases as:

• 000 – Not Charging

•  001 – Trickle Charge (VBAT < VBAT_SHORTZ)

•  010 – Pre-charge (VBAT_SHORTZ < VBAT < VBAT_LOWV)

• 011 – Fast Charge (CC mode)

• 100 – Taper Charge (CV mode)

• 101 – Reserved

• 110 – Top-off Timer Active Charging

• 111 – Charge Termination Done

When the charger transitions to any of these states, including when the charge cycle completes, an 
INT is
asserted to notify the host.

9.3.9.2 Battery Charging Profile

The device charges the battery in five phases: trickle charge, pre-charge, constant current, 
constant voltage, and
top-off trickle charging (optional). At the beginning of a charging cycle, the device checks the 
battery voltage and
regulates current/voltage accordingly.

Table 9-10. Default Charging Current Setting

VBAT         CHARGING CURRENT   REGISTER DEFAULT SETTING      CHRG_STAT

< VBAT_SHORT           IBAT_SHORT         100 mA (fixed value)           001

> VBAT_LOWV             ICHG               1 A                011

If the charger is in DPM regulation or thermal regulation during charging, the actual charging 
current is less than
the programmed value. In this case, termination is temporarily disabled and the charging safety 
timer is counted
at half the clock rate, as explained in Section 9.3.9.4.

During SYSMIN regulation with BATFET LDO operation, the charge current is limited to 2 A maximum,
regardless of the charge current register setting being set higher than 2 A, in order to protect 
the BATFET. It is
not recommended to set the battery regulation voltage lower than the SYSMIN regulation voltage. The 
BATFET
LDO operation can be disabled by setting DIS_LDO = 1. In this state, charge current is regulated 
according to
Table 9-10 and SYS voltage is V(BAT) plus the IR drop through the BATFET, regardless of battery 
voltage. No
VSYSMIN is maintained. Note that, when in trickle charge, setting DIS_LDO = 1 does not affect 
IBAT_SHORT.

VBAT_SHORTZ is the battery voltage threshold for transition from trickle charge to precharge, which 
is fixed at

2.25V typical. During the trickle charge to precharge transition, the charger regulates the battery 
voltage to 2.5V/
cell typical for tBAT_SHORTZ duration. VBAT_LOWV is the battery voltage threshold for the 
transition from precharge
to fast charge. It is defined as a ratio of battery voltage regulation limit (VREG).

9.3.9.3 Charging Termination

The device terminates a charge cycle when the battery voltage is above the recharge threshold, the 
converter
is operated in the battery constant voltage regulation loop and the current is below the 
termination current. After
the charging cycle is completed, the BATFET turns off. The converter keeps running to power the 
system and
the                                                     BATFET can turn on again if the supplement 
mode is triggered.

When termination is done, the status register CHG_STAT is set to 111 and an INT pulse is asserted 
to the
host. Termination is temporarily disabled when the charger device is in input current (IINDPM), 
input voltage
(VINDPM) or thermal (TREG) regulation. Termination can be permanently disabled by writing 0 to 
EN_TERM bit
prior to charging termination. Writing 0 to EN_TERM when the termination has already occurred or in 
the top-off
charging stage does not disable termination, until the next charging cycle has been restarted. If 
termination is
enabled by setting EN_TERM = 1 during an active charging cycle, the change is applied immediately.

At low termination currents (from 40mA to 160mA), due to the comparator offset, the actual 
termination current
may be up to 20%~40% higher than the termination target. In order to compensate for the comparator 
offset,
a programmable top-off timer (default disabled) can be activated after termination. Whlie the 
top-off timer is
running, the device continues to charge the battery in constant voltage mode (BATFET stays on) 
until the top-off
time expires. The top-off timer follows safety timer constraints, such that if the safety timer is 
suspended, so is
the top-off timer, and if the safety timer is doubled, so is the top-off timer. CHG_STAT reports 
whether the top off
timer is active via the 110 code. Once the top-off timer expires, charging terminates, the CHG_STAT 
register is
set to 111 and an INT pulse is asserted to the host.

The top-off timer gets reset (set to 0 and counting resumes when appropriate) for any of the 
following conditions:

1. Charge disable to enable

2. Termination status low to high

3. REG_RST register bit is set (disables top-off timer)

Once the charger detects termination, the charger reads the top-off timer (TOPOFF_TMR) settings.
Programming the top-off timer value after termination has no effect unless a recharge cycle is 
initiated. The
top-off timer only starts to count when the charger's termination criteria are met. If EN_TERM = 0, 
the charger
never terminates charging, so the top-off timer does not start counting, even if it is enabled. An 
INT is asserted to
the host when the top-off timer starts counting as well as when the top-off timer expires. All 
charge cycle related
INT pulses (including top-off timer INT pulse) can be masked by CHG_MASK bit.

9.3.9.4 Charging Safety Timer

The device has a built-in safety timer to prevent an extended charging cycle due to abnormal 
battery conditions.
The user can program the fast charge safety timer through I2C (CHG_TMR bits). When the fast charge 
safety
timer expires, the fault register CHG_TMR_STAT bit is set to 1, and an INT pulse is asserted to the 
host. The
trickle charge timer is fixed 1 hour. The pre-charge safety timer is adjustable 2 hours (POR 
default) or 0.5 hour.
The fast charging timer POR default setting is 12 hours.

The trickle charge, pre-charge and fast charge safety timers can be disabled by setting 
EN_TRICHG_TMR,
EN_PRECHG_TMR or EN_CHG_TMR bit to 0. Each charging safety timer can be enabled anytime regardless
of the current charging state. Each timer restarts counting when it is enabled. As soon as each 
charging stage
is initiated, the associated safety timer starts to count, which is illustrated in the battery 
charging profile chart
shown in Section 9.3.9.2.

During input voltage, current or thermal regulation, the safety timer counts at half-clock rate as 
the actual
charge current is likely to be below the register setting. For example, if the charger is in input 
current regulation
(IINDPM_STAT = 1) throughout the whole charging cycle, and the safety timer is set to 5 hours, then 
the timer
will expire in 10 hours. This half-clock rate feature can be disabled by setting TMR2X_EN = 0. If 
the host
disables the half-clock rate while the charger is already running at half-clock rate, the charger 
keeps running at
the half-clock rate and the half-clock rate is not disabled until the charger exit the voltage, 
current or thermal
regulation.

During faults which disable charging or supplement mode, the timer is suspended. Since the timer is 
not
counting in this state, the TMR2X_EN bit has no effect. Once the fault goes away, the safety timer 
resumes. The
pre-charge safety timer and the trickle charge safety timer follow the same rules as the fast 
charge safety timer
in terms of getting suspended, reset and counting at half-rate when TMR2X_EN is set.

The fast charge timer is reset at the following events:

1. Charging cycle stop and restart (toggle CE pin, EN_CHG bit, or charged battery falls below 
recharge
threshold after termination)

2. BAT voltage changes from pre-charge to fast-charge or vice versa (in host-mode or default mode)

3. A change of the value of CHG_TMR[1:0] register bits

The pre-charge timer is reset at the following events:

1. Charging cycle stop and restart (toggle CE pin, EN_CHG bit, or charged battery falls below 
recharge
threshold)

2. BAT voltage changes from trickle charge to pre-charge or vice versa, pre-charge to fast charge 
or vice versa
(in host-mode or default mode)

3. A change of the value of PRECHG_TMR register bit.

The trickle charge timer is reset at the following events:

1. Charging cycle stop and restart (toggle CE pin, EN_CHG bit, or charged battery falls below 
recharge
threshold)

2. BAT voltage changes from trickle charge to pre-charge or vice versa (in host-mode or default 
mode)

9.3.9.5 Thermistor Qualification

The charger device provides a single thermistor input for battery temperature monitoring.

9.3.9.5.1 JEITA Guideline Compliance in Charge Mode

To improve the safety of charging Li-ion batteries, JEITA guideline was released on April 20, 2007. 
The guideline
emphasized the importance of avoiding a high charge current and high charge voltage at certain low 
and high
temperature ranges.

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

To initiate a charge cycle, the voltage on TS pin must be within the VT1 to VT5 thresholds. If TS 
voltage exceeds
the VT1-VT5 range, the controller suspends charging and waits until the battery temperature is 
within the T1 to
T5                                                       range.

At cool temperature T1-T2, JEITA recommends to reduce the charge current to be lower than half of 
the charge
current at normal temperature T2-T3. The device provides the programmability of the charge current 
at T1-T2, to
be 20%, 40% or 100% of the charge current at T2-T3 or charge suspend, which is controlled by the 
register bits
JEITA_ISETC.

The device provides the programmability of the charge voltage at T3-T5, to be with a voltage offset 
(0mV,
100mV or 200mV) less than charge voltage at T2-T3 or charge suspend, which is controlled by the 
register bits
JEITA_VSET.

The charger also provides flexible voltage/current settings beyond the JEITA requirements. The 
charge current
setting at warm temperature T3-T5 can be configured to be 20%, 40% or 100% of the charge current at 
T2-T3 or
charge                                                       suspend, which is programmed by the 
register bits JEITA_ISETH.

The charge termination is still enabled (when EN_TERM=1) at cool temperature T1-T2 and warm 
temperature
T3-T5. The termination current will be kept as the same in all different temperature ranges. In the 
normal
operation, the charge will be terminated based on the charge current is lower than the termination 
current, the
battery voltage is higher than the battery recharge voltage and the charger is in the battery 
voltage regulation
loop. When the temperature enters T1-T2 or T3-T5, the charge current might drop to 20% or 40% of 
that at
T2-T3, which might be lower than the termination current setting. If at this moment, the battery 
voltage is already
higher than the battery recharge voltage and the charger is in the battery voltage regulation loop, 
the charge will
be terminated.

At warm temperature T3-T5, the battery charge voltage will becomes lower. If the battery voltage is 
already
very close to the battery charge voltage at T2-T3, to reduce the charge voltage by an offset might 
trigger the
VBAT_OVP. The charger should response as the normal VBAT_OVP protection under this scenario.

At cool temperature T1-T2 or warm temperature T3-T5, the charge current will become different from 
that at
the normal temperature range T2-T3, the safety timer should be adjusted accordingly. The safety 
timer will be
suspended when the charge is suspended, and will run at half of the clock rate when the charge 
current is
reduced to 20% or 40%, and will keep the same when the charge current is unchanged.

JEITA charging values are shown in Figure 9-11, in which the blue real line is the default setting 
and the red
dash line is the programmable options.

The NTC monitoring on the battery temperature can be ignored by the charger if TS_IGNORE = 1. When

The
TS_STAT including TS_COLD_STAT, TS_COOL_STAT, TS_WARM_STAT and TS_HOT_STAT, always report
000 with TS_IGNORE = 1.

When TS_IGNORE = 0, the charger adjusts the charging profile based on the TS pin feedback 
information.
When the battery temperature crosses from one temperature range to the other one, the associated TS 
status
bits are updated accordingly. The TS flag bits are set for the temperature range for which the TS 
voltage is
reporting, and an INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if TS_MASK is low. The FLAG and INT pulse

where VT# are the percentages of V(REGN) per the electrical spec table. The BQ25798 provides 
comparators
with fixed thresholds for VT1 x V(REGN) and VT5 x V(REGN), and comparators with programmable 
thresholds
for VT2 x V(REGN) and VT3 x V(REGN). The thresholds for VT2 x V(REGN) and VT3 x V(REGN) are 
controlled
by TS_COOL and TS_WARM. This programmability gives more flexibility for the configuration of the 
JEITA
profile. Select T1=0°C and T5=60°C for Li-ion or Li-polymer battery, the RT1 and RT2 are calculated 
to be

5.24KΩ and 30.31KΩ respectively.

9.3.9.5.2 Cold/Hot Temperature Window in OTG Mode

For battery protection during OTG mode, the device monitors the battery temperature to be within 
the VBCOLD
to VBHOT thresholds. When RT1 is 5.24 KΩ and RT2 is 31.31 KΩ, TBCOLD default is -10°C and TBHOT
default is 60°C. When the temperature is outside of this range, OTG mode is suspended, the 
converter stops
switching. The charger waits in OTG mode (EN_OTG = 1). In addition, the VBUS_STAT bits are set to 
000
and  the corresponding TS_COLD_STAT or TS_HOT_STAT is reported. Once temperature returns to the 
normal
temperature                                                  range, OTG mode is recovered and TS 
stauts bit is cleared. During TS fault, REGN remains on.

9.3.10 Integrated 16-Bit ADC for Monitoring

The device has an integrated 16-bit ADC to provide the user with critical system information for 
optimizing the
behavior of the charger. The ADC is controlled through the ADC Control register. The ADC_EN bit 
provides
the ability to disable the ADC in order to conserve power dissipation. The ADC_RATE bit allows 
continuous
conversion or one-shot behavior. After a 1-shot conversion finishes, the ADC_EN bit is cleared, and 
must be re-
asserted to start a new conversion. The ADC_AVG bit enables or disables (default) averaging. 
ADC_AVG_INIT
starts average using the existing (default) or using a new ADC value.

To enable the ADC, the ADC_EN bit must be set to 1. The ADC is allowed to operate if either VBUS > 
3.4 V
or VBAT > 2.9 V is valid. If ADC_EN is set to 1 before VBUS or VBAT reaches its valid threshold, 
then the
ADC conversion is postponed until one of the power supplies reaches the threshold. If the charger 
is in HIZ
mode, the ADC still can be enabled by setting ADC_EN = 1. At battery only condition, if the TS_ADC 
channel
is enabled, the ADC only works when battery voltage is higher than 3.2V, otherwise, the ADC works 
when the
battery voltage is higher than 2.9V.

The ADC_SAMPLE bits control the ADC sample speed, with conversion times of tADC_CONV. If the host 
changes
the sample speed in the middle of an ADC conversion, the ADC conversion stops the channel being 
converted,
and that channel is reconverted at the new rate. At that point, some of the ADC register values 
might have been
converted with one sample rate and others with a different sample rate.

By default, all ADC channels are enabled with 1-shot or continuous conversion mode unless the 
channel is
disabled in the ADC_Function_Disable_0 or ADC_Function_Disable_1 register. If an ADC channel is 
disabled
by setting the corresponding register bit, then the value in that register is from the last valid 
ADC conversion
or the default POR value (all zeros.) If an ADC channel is disabled in the middle of an ADC 
measurement
cycle, the device finishes the conversion of that channel. Even though no conversion takes place 
when all
ADC channels are disabled, the ADC circuitry is active and ready to begin conversion as soon as one 
of
the bits in the ADC_Function_Disable_0 or ADC_Function_Disable_1 register is set to 0. In order to 
achieve
the lowest quiescent current when disabling all ADC channels, set EN_ADC to 0 instead of disabling 
with
ADC_Function_Disable_0 and ADC_Function_Disable_1.

The ADC_DONE_STAT and ADC_DONE_FLAG bits are set when a conversion is complete in 1-shot mode
only. This event produces an INT pulse, which can be masked with ADC_DONE_MASK. During continuous
conversion mode, the ADC_DONE_STAT and ADC_DONE_FLAG bits have no meaning and remain 0.

ADC conversion operates independently of the faults present in the device. ADC conversion continues 
even
after a fault has occurred. ADC readings are only valid for DC states and not for transients.

If the host wants to exit the ADC more gracefully, it is recommended to write ADC_RATE to one-shot 
in order to
force the ADC to stop at the end of a complete cycle of conversions.

• IBUS (positive in forward converter mode)

When one of the above conditions occurs (a rising edge on any of the *_STAT bits), the device sends 
out an
INT pulse and keeps track of which source generated the INT via the FLAG registers. The FLAG 
register bits are
automatically reset to zero after the host reads them, and a new edge on STAT bit is required to 
re-assert the
FLAG. This sequence is illustrated in Figure 9-14.

9.3.12 Ship FET Control

The charger provides an N-FET driving pin (SDRV) to control an external ship FET. The SDRV pin is 
the output
of a charge pump that provides 100 nA typical drive current to drive the ship FET gate to typically 
5-V above
the battery voltage. When this ship FET is off, it removes leakage current from the battery to the 
system. The
ship FET is controlled by the SDRV_CTRL[1:0] register bits, to support the shutdown mode, ship mode 
and the
system power reset.

•  IDLE Mode when SDRV_CTRL[1:0] = 00, POR default. The external ship FET is fully on, I2C is 
enabled. The
internal BATFET status is determined by the charging status. This mode is valid with adapter 
present, during
forward charging, in OTG mode or in the battery only condition.

•  Shutdown Mode when SDRV_CTRL[1:0] = 01. The ship FET turns off. The I2C is disabled. The charger 
is

totally shutdown and can only be woken up by an adapter plug-in. This mode can only be entered when 
no
adapter is present. If SDRV_CTRL[1:0] is written to 01 with an adapter present, the write is 
ignored.

•  Ship Mode when SDRV_CTRL[1:0] = 10. The ship FET turns off. The I2C is still enabled. The 
charger can

be woken up by setting SDRV_CTRL[1:0] back to 00, or pulling the QON pin low, or an adapter 
plug-in. This
mode can only be entered when no adapter is present. If SDRV_CTRL[1:0] is written to 01 with an 
adapter
present, the write is ignored.

•  System Power Reset when SDRV_CTRL[1:0] = 11. The ship FET is turned off for typical 350ms to 
reset
the                                                     system power (converter goes to HIZ mode if 
VBUS is high), then the ship FET is fully turned on
again. The BATFET keeps the status unchanged during the system power reset. After the reset is done,
SDRV_CTRL[1:0] goes back to 00.

When the host changes SDRV_CTRL[1:0] from 00 to the other values, the charger turns off the ship FET
immediately or delays by tSM_DLY as configured by SDRV_DLY bit. The application diagram when the 
battery is
connected to the charger through an external ship FET is illustrated in the figure below.

9.3.12.1 Shutdown Mode

To further reduce battery leakage current, the host can shut down the charger by setting the 
register bits
SDRV_CTRL[1:0] to 01. In this mode, the I2C is disabled and the charger is totally shut down. The 
device can
only be woken up by plugging in an adapter.

After the SDRV_CTRL[1:0] is set to 01, the external ship FET turns off either immediately or after 
waiting for 10s
as configured by SDRV_DLY register bit. When VBUS is high because of an adapter being present or 
the OTG
mode being enable, SDRV_CTRL[1:0] will be reset to 00 if the host writes it to 01.

When the device exits shutdown mode, the SDRV_CTRL bits are reset to the POR default values (00).

9.3.12.2 Ship Mode

To extend battery life and minimize the system power loss when system is powered off during idle, 
shipping or
storage, the device can turn off BATFET and external ship FET to minimize the battery leakage 
current. The ship
mode is enabled when the host sets SDRV_CTRL[1:0] to 10. The I2C is still enabled, but the charger 
system
clock slows down to minimize the device quiescent current.

After the SDRV_CTRL[1:0] is set to 10, the external ship FET is turned off either immediately or 
after waiting 10
seconds as configured by SDRV_DLY register bit. When VBUS is high because of an adapter being 
present or
OTG mode being enabled, SDRV_CTRL[1:0] automatically resets to 00 if the host writes it to 10.

The following events will cause an exit from ship mode:

• Plug in an adapter

• Set SDRV_CTRL[1:0] = 00

•  Set REG_RST = 1, to reset all the registers including SDRV_CTRL bits back to default (00)

•  A logic low of tSM_EXIT (typical 1s or 15ms programmed by WKUP_DLY bit) duration on QON pin

The charger exits ship mode by turning on the ship FET and internal BATFET to reconnect the battery 
to the
system and resetting SDRV_CTRL bits to their POR default value (00).

9.3.12.3 System Power Reset

The host can reset the system power by:

• Set the register bits SDRV_CTRL[1:0] to 11

• A logic low of tRST (typical 10s) duration on QON pin

When the system power reset is enabled, the device turns off the ship FET for tRST_SFET (typical 
350ms) and
also sets the charger in HIZ mode if VBUS is high. After the tRST_SFET completes, the device then 
turns on the

ship FET and disables the charger HIZ mode. While the SFET is off, the charger applies a 30mA 
(typical ) sink
current on SYS to discharge system voltage.

Regardless of whether the charger is at battery only condition or in the forward charging mode with 
adapter
present, the charger resets the system power when the SDRV_CTRL[1:0] bits are set to 11 or the QON 
pin is
pulled low for tRST duration.

9.3.13 Protections

9.3.13.1 Voltage and Current Monitoring

The device closely monitors the input, system and battery voltage and current, as well as internal 
FET currents
for                                                        safe converter operation. It provides 
the following protection faults :

• VAC Over-voltage Protection (VAC_OVP)

• VBUS Over-voltage Protection (VBUS_OVP)

• VBUS Under-voltage Protection (POORSRC)

• System Over-voltage Protection (VSYS_OVP)

• System Short Protection (VSYS_SHORT)

• Battery Over-voltage Protection (VBAT_OVP)

• Battery Over-current Protection (IBAT_OCP)

• Input Over-current Protection (IBUS_OCP)

• OTG Over-voltage Protection (OTG_OVP)

• OTG Under-voltage Protection (OTG_UVP)

9.3.13.1.1 VAC Over-voltage Protection (VAC_OVP)

The charger has a programmable VVAC_OVP threshold. When the VAC1 or VAC2 voltage is higher than 
VVAC_OVP
threshold per I2C register field, the corresponding ACDRV pin turns off the ACFET-RBFET. An /INT 
pulse is
asserted to alert the host, if the related MASK is low, and the related VACx_OVP_STAT and 
VAC_OVP_FLAG
report the fault. The charger automatically changes to the valid VAC input if available The ACDRV 
pin
automatically turns the ACFET-RBFET on again when the over-voltage condition goes away.

9.3.13.1.2 VBUS Over-voltage Protection (VBUS_OVP)

When the VBUS voltage is higher than VVBUS_OVP (typical 26 V), the converter stops switching 
immediately to
protect the internal power MOSFETs. As the SYS voltage falls below the battery voltage, the BATFET 
is turned
on to supplement the system load. During VBUS over-voltage, an INT pulse is asserted to alert the 
host, if the
VBUS_OVP_MASK is low, the VBUS_OVP_STAT and VBUS_OV_FLAG registers report the fault. The device
automatically starts switching again when the VBUS voltage drops below the threshold.

9.3.13.1.3 VBUS Under-voltage Protection (POORSRC)

At power up, the charger pulls IPOORSRC from the input source. If the VBUS voltage falls below 
VPOORSRC,
the charger considers the input voltage as being under-voltage and stops switching. The charger 
issues an
INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if the PG_MASK is low and the POORSRC_FLAG, PG_FLAG and PG
STATUS registers report the fault. The charger repeatedly tests for poor source again after 7 
minutes typical until
a valid source is attached.

9.3.13.1.4 System Over-voltage Protection (VSYS_OVP)

If the system voltage rises higher than VSYS_OVP threshold, the converter stops switching to 
protect the power
MOSFETs. A /INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if VSYS_OVP_MASK is low and the VSYS_OVP_STAT 
and
VSYS_OVP_FLAG registers report the fault. Normal switching resumes when the system voltage returns 
to its
regulation point.

9.3.13.1.5 System Short Protection (VSYS_SHORT)

When VSYS drops below VSYS_SHORT (2.2V typical), the charger limits the converter output current
to less than 1 A. An /INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if VSYS_SHORT_MASK is low and the
VSYS_SHORT_STAT and VSYS_SHORT_FLAG registers report the fault.

9.3.13.1.6 Battery Over-voltage Protection (VBAT_OVP)

When the battery voltage is detected to be higher than 104% typical of the battery charging 
regulation voltage,
the charger turns off the converter to prevent the battery voltage from further increasing. When 
the battery
voltage drops below 102% typical of the battery charging regulation voltage, the converter 
automatically restarts.
The system load is supplied by battery through battery FET when the converter is disabled. A /INT 
pulse is
asserted to alert the host if the VBAT_OVP_MASK is low and the VBAT_OVP_STAT and VBAT_OVP_FLAG
register bits report the fault.

9.3.13.1.7 Battery Over-current Protection (IBAT_OCP)

Battery over-current protection is available when external ship FET (SFET) is assembled, 
SFET_PRESENT bit
is set to 1, and EN_BATOC bit is set to 1. When discharge current exceeds IBAT_OCP, the SFET turns 
off
to stop the discharge current. Regardless of the EN_BATOC bit setting, when the battery discharging 
current
becomes higher than IBATOC, an /INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if IBAT_OCP_MASK is low and 
the
IBAT_OCP_STAT and IBAT_OCP_FLAG register bits report the fault.

9.3.13.1.8 Input Over-current Protection (IBUS_OCP)

When EN_IBUS_OCP=1, the charger monitors the input current in forward charging mode in order to 
provide
IBUS over current protection. If the input current exceeds the IBUS over current threshold IBUS_OCP
(typical 8A), the charger disables the converter by setting the EN_HIZ bit to 1. In addition, the 
charger sets
DIS_ACDRV=1 in order to disable both ACDRV1 and ACDRV2. The battery FET turns on to supplement the
system load as needed. The host must set EN_HIZ and DIS_ACDRV bits to 0 in order to restart the 
converter.
Alternatively, removing and replacing the adapter resets the EN_HIZ bit and the DIS_ACDRV bit to 0. 
When
EN_IBUS_OCP=0, IBUS over current protection is disabled. Regardless of the EN_ IBUS_OCP bit setting,
when the IBUS input current becomes higher than IBUS_OCP, an /INT pulse is asserted to alert the 
host if
IBUS_OCP_MASK is low, the IBUS_OCP_STAT and IBUS_OCP_FLAG register bits report the fault.

9.3.13.1.9 OTG Over-voltage Protection (OTG_OVP)

When the VBUS voltage rises above VOTG_OVP rising threshold, the converter stops switching in the 
next
switching cycle in order to protect the power MOSFETs. The converter resumes switching when the VBUS
voltage falls below the VOTG_OVP falling threshold. When OTG_OVP is detected, a /INT pulse is 
asserted
to alert the host if OTG_OVP_MASK is low and the VOTG_OVP_STAT and VOTG_OVP_FLAG fault registers
report the fault.

9.3.13.1.10 OTG Under-voltage Protection (OTG_UVP)

After the converter turns on if the VBUS voltage is lower than VOTG_UVP threshold, the charger 
shuts down
for 500ms and retry to turn on. An /INT pulse is asserted to alert the host if OTG_UVP_MASK is low 
and the
OTG_UVP_FLAG register reports the fault.

9.3.13.2 Thermal Regulation and Thermal Shutdown

The device monitors its internal junction temperature (TJ) to avoid overheating and to limit the IC 
surface
temperature. When the internal junction temperature exceeds the preset thermal regulation limit 
(TREG bits), the
device reduces the charge current or OTG output current to maintain the junction temperature at the 
thermal
regulation limit. A wide thermal regulation range from 60°C to 120°C allows optimization of the 
system thermal
performance. During thermal regulation, the actual charging current is usually below the programmed 
value in
the ICHG registers. Therefore, termination is disabled, the fast charging safety timer runs at half 
the clock rate,
the status register TREG_STAT bit goes high, TREG_FLAG bit is set to 1, and an INT is asserted to 
alert host
unless TREG_MASK is set to 1.

Additionally, the device has thermal shutdown to turn off the converter when the IC junction 
temperature exceeds
the TSHUT threshold. The fault register bits TSHUT_STAT and TSHUT_FLAG are set and an INT pulse is
asserted to the host, unless TSHUT_MASK is set to 1. The BATFET and the converter resumes normal
operation when the IC die temperature decreases lower than TSHUT threshold by TSHUT_HYS.

9.3.14 Serial Interface

The device uses I2C compatible interface for flexible charging parameter programming and 
instantaneous device
status reporting. I2C is a bi-directional 2-wire serial interface. Only two open-drain bus lines 
are required: a
serial data line (SDA), and a serial clock line (SCL). Devices can be considered as controllers or 
targets when
performing data transfers. A controller is a device which initiates a data transfer on the bus and 
generates the
clock signals to permit that transfer. At that time, any device addressed is considered a target.

The device operates as a target device with 7-bit address 0x6B, receiving control inputs from the 
controller
device like micro-controller or digital signal processor through REG00 – REG25. Register read 
beyond REG25
(0x25), returns 0xFF. The I2C interface supports both standard mode (up to 100 kbits/s), and fast 
mode (up to
400 kbits/s). When the bus is free, both lines are HIGH. The SDA and SCL pins are open drain and 
must be
connected                                                        to the positive supply voltage via 
a current source or pull-up resistor.

9.3.14.1 Data Validity

The data on the SDA line must be stable during the HIGH period of the clock. The HIGH or LOW state 
of the
data line can only change when the clock signal on SCL line is LOW. One clock pulse is generated 
for each data
bit transferred.

SDA

Data line stable;
Data valid

Figure 9-16. Bit Transfers on the I2C Bus

9.3.14.2 START and STOP Conditions

All transactions begin with a START (S) and are terminated with a STOP (P). A HIGH to LOW 
transition on the
SDA line while SCL is HIGH defines a START condition. A LOW to HIGH transition on the SDA line when 
the
SCL is HIGH defines a STOP condition.

START and STOP conditions are always generated by the controller. The bus is considered busy after 
the
START condition, and free after the STOP condition.

Every byte on the SDA line must be 8 bits long. The number of bytes to be transmitted per transfer 
is
unrestricted. Each byte has to be followed by an ACKNOWLEDGE (ACK) bit. Data is transferred with

Most Significant Bit (MSB) first. If a target cannot receive or transmit another complete byte of 
data until it
has performed some other function, it can hold the SCL line low to force the controller into a wait 
state (clock
stretching). Data transfer then continues when the target is ready for another byte of data and 
releases the SCL
line.

9.3.14.4 Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NACK)

The ACK signaling takes place after each transmitted byte. The ACK bit allows the receiver to 
signal the
transmitter that the byte was successfully received and another byte may be sent. All clock pulses, 
including the
acknowledge 9th clock pulse, are generated by the controller.

The transmitter releases the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so the receiver can pull 
the SDA line
LOW and it remains stable LOW during the HIGH period of this 9th clock pulse.

A NACK is signaled when the SDA line remains HIGH during the 9th clock pulse. The controller can 
then
generate either a STOP to abort the transfer or a repeated START to start a new transfer.

9.3.14.5 Target Address and Data Direction Bit

After the START signal, a target address is sent. This address is 7 bits long, followed by the 8 
bit as a data
direction bit (bit R/ W). A zero indicates a transmission (WRITE) and a one indicates a request for 
data (READ).
The BQ25798 7-bit address is defined as 1101 011' (0x6B). The address bit arrangement is shown 
below.

9.4 Device Functional Modes

9.4.1 Host Mode and Default Mode

Figure 9-24. Multi-Read

The device is a host controlled charger, but it can operate in default mode without host 
management. In default
mode, the device can be used as an autonomous charger with no host or while host is in sleep mode. 
When the
charger is in default mode, WD_STAT bit becomes HIGH, WD_FLAG is set to 1, and an INT is asserted 
low to
alert the host (unless masked by WD_MASK). The WD_FLAG bit would read as 1 upon the first read and 
then 0
upon subsequent reads. When the charger is in host mode, WD_STAT bit is LOW.

After power-on-reset, the device starts in default mode with watchdog timer expired. All the 
registers are in the
default settings.

In default mode, the device keeps charging the battery with default 1-hour trickle charging safety 
timer, 2-hour
pre-charging safety timer and the 12-hour fast charging safety timer. At the end of the 1-hour or 
2-hour or
12-hour timer expired, the charging is stopped and the buck-boost converter continues to operate to 
supply
system load.

A write to any I2C register transitions the charger from default mode to host mode, and initiates 
the watchdog
timer. All the device parameters can be programmed by the host. To keep the device in host mode, 
the host has
to reset the watchdog timer by writing 1 to WD_RST bit before the watchdog timer expires (WD_STAT 
bit is set),
or disable watchdog timer by setting WATCHDOG bits = 00.

When the watchdog timer is expired, the device returns to default mode and all registers are reset 
to default
values except the ones described in Section 9.5. The watchdog timer will be reset on any write if

9.4.2 Register Bit Reset

Beside the register reset by the watchdog timer in the default mode, the register and the timer 
could be reset
to the default value by writing the REG_RST bit to 1. The register bits, which can be reset by the 
REG_RST
bit, are noted in the Register Map section. After the register reset, the REG_RST bit will go back 
from 1 to 0
automatically.

The register reset by the REG_RST bit will not initiate the ACFET-RBFET detection, which is only 
done at the
charger first time POR. It will not repeat the open-circuit adapter measurements for the default 
VINDPM setting,
which in only done when an adapter is plugged in. In addition, if the charger is in the process of 
forced ICO, the
forced open-circuit adapter measurements or the forced D+/D- detection, set the REG_RST to 1 will 
terminate
all of these processes, because reset the register to default values will set FORCE_ICO, 
FORCE_INDET and
FORCE_VINDPM_DET bits to 0.

10 Application and Implementation

Note

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,
and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for
determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their 
design
implementation to confirm system functionality.

10.1 Application Information

A typical application consists of the device configured as an I2C controlled power path management 
battery
backup device and a multi-cell battery charger for Li-Ion and Li-polymer batteries. It integrates 
the four switching
MOSFETs (Q₁ to Q₄) for the buck-boost converter, and the battery FET (BATFET) between system and 
battery.
The device also integrates the input current sensing and charging current sensing circuitries, the 
bootstrap diode
for the high-side gate driving and the dual-input power mux for the power sources selection.

The charger's MPPT algorithm allows a simple but efficient interface between the charger and a small
photovoltaic panel. The power mux may optionally be used to add a secondary charging port such as a 
barrel
jack or USB input.

For applications that will enable backup mode, it is required that RBFET and ACFET are populated in 
the input
power multiplexer. When backup mode is entered, the ACDRV turns off the RBFET and ACFET to block the
converter output from propagating out to the adapter connector. EN_BACKUP cannot be set to 1 to 
enable
backup mode if RBFET and ACFET are not detected at POR.

10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

10.2.2.1 PV Panel Selection

BQ25798 has a 3.6 to 24V wide input voltage range, allowing it to interface with 6V, 9V and 12V 
photovoltaic
panels. Two critical parameters of the PV panel are the open circuit voltage, VOC, and the maximum 
power point
voltage, VMPP. The open-circuit voltage should not exceed the 24V recommended operating condition 
of VIN1
or VIN2. BQ25798 has a small-PV maximum power point tracking algorithm (see Section 9.3.6.3) to 
simplify the
interface to the solar panel while maintaining high effiiency.

The ratio of maximum power point voltage to open circuit voltage can change over differing 
conditions such as
temperature and irradiance, but the ratio of VMPP / VOC as provided in the PV panel manufacturer's 
datasheet
provides a good estimate to use when configuraing VOC_PCT. For a panel with VOC = 10.0 Vand VMPP = 
8.0 V,
the calculated maximum power point ratio is 8.0 V / 10.0 V = 80.0%. A setting of VOC_PCT = 4 
(81.25%) is a
good starting configuration for this panel. Users may wish to characterize their PV panel's 
operation over their
specific application conditions of temperature, irradiance, humidity and other parameters in order 
to adjust this
setting if necessary.

10.2.2.2 Inductor Selection

The device has 1.5 MHz switching frequency to allow the use of small inductor (1µH) and capacitor 
values.
It also provide the 750kHz switching frequency to achieve higher efficiency for the applications 
which have
enough design space to accommodate the larger inductor (2.2 µH) and capacitors. Please note that 
the 1.5 MHz
switching frequency only works with the 1µH inductor and the 750 kHz switching frequency only works 
with the

2.2µH inductor.

Because the converter might be either operated in the buck mode or the boost mode, so the inductor 
current is
equal to either the charging current or the input current. The inductor saturation current should 
be higher than
the larger value of the input current (IIN) or the charging current (ICHG) plus half the ripple 
current (IRIPPLE):

(4)

The inductor ripple current (IRIPPLE) depends on the input voltage (VBUS), the output voltage 
(VSYS), the switching
frequency (FSW) and the inductance (L). The inductor current ripples for buck mode and boost mode 
are
calculated with equations (4) and (5), respectively:

The inductor current ripple in the buck mode is usually larger than that in the boost mode, since 
the voltage-
second applied on the inductor is larger. The maximum inductor current ripple in the buck mode 
happens in the
vicinity of D = VSYS / VBUS = 0.5. The SYS voltage is approximately 8V for the 2s battery 
configuration, so the
worst case for the inductor ripples is with the 15V or 20V input voltage.

10.2.2.3 Input (VBUS / PMID) Capacitor

In the buck mode operation, the input current is discontinuous, which dominates the input RMS 
ripple current
and input voltage ripple. The input capacitors should have enough ripple current rating to absorb 
the input
AC current and have large enough capacitance to maintain the small input voltage ripple. For the 
buck mode
operation, the input RMS ripple current is calculated by the equation (6) and the input voltage 
ripple is calculated
by  the equation (7), where D = VSYS / VBUS.

(7)

(8)

The worst case input RMS ripple current and input voltage ripple both occur at 0.5 duty cycle 
condition. The
SYS voltage is approximately 8V for the 2s battery configuration, so the worst case is when 15V to 
20V VBUS
condition. Low ESR ceramic capacitor such as X7R or X5R is preferred for the input decoupling 
capacitor and
should be placed close to the PMID and GND pins of the IC. The voltage rating of the capacitor must 
be higher
than the normal input voltage level. The capacitor with 25V or higher voltage rating is preferred 
for up to 20V
input voltage. 1*0.1 μF + 3*10 μF ceramic capacitors are suggested for up to 3.3-A input current 
limit to support
the converter in forward mode.

The PMID capacitance also holds up the PMID rail during the transition into backup mode when the 
adapter
is removed. For applications that utilize the backup mode an additional 2*33 uF POSCAP is 
recommended at
PMID.

10.2.2.4 Output (VSYS) Capacitor

In the boost mode operation, the output current is discontinuous, which dominates the output RMS 
ripple current
and output voltage ripple. The output capacitors should have enough ripple current rating to absorb 
the output
AC current and have large enough capacitance to maintain the small output voltage ripple. For the 
boost mode
operation, the output RMS ripple current is calculated by the equation (8) and the output voltage 
ripple is
calculated by the equation (9), where D = (1 - VBUS / VSYS).

(9)

(10)

The worst case output RMS ripple current and output voltage ripple both occur at the lowest VBUS 
input voltage.
The SYS voltage is approximately 8V for the 2s battery configuration, so the worst case is 5V VBUS 
condition.
Low ESR ceramic capacitor such as X7R or X5R is preferred for the output decoupling capacitor and 
should
be placed close to the SYS and GND pins of the IC. The voltage rating of the capacitor must be 
higher than

11 Power Supply Recommendations

BQ25798

SLUSDV2B – MAY 2020 – REVISED JANUARY 2023

In order to provide an output voltage on SYS, the device requires a power supply between 3.6 V and 
24 V input
with recommended >500mA current rating connected to VBUS or a 1s to 4s Li-Ion battery with voltage 
higher
than VBAT_UVLO connected to BAT. The source current rating needs to be at least 3A for the 
buck-boost converter
of the charger to provide maximum output power to SYS.

12 Layout

12.1 Layout Guidelines

The switching nodes rising and falling times should be minimized for minimum switching loss. Proper 
layout of
the components to minimize the high frequency current path loops (shown in the figure below) is 
important to
prevent the electrical and magnetic field radiation and the high frequency resonant problems. Here 
is a PCB
layout priority list for proper layout. Layout PCB according to this specific order is essential.

1.  Place the SYS output capacitors as close to SYS and GND as possible. Place a 0.1 µF small size 
(such as
0402 or 0201) capacitor closer than the other 10 µF capacitors. Ground connections need to be tied 
to the
IC ground with a short copper trace connection or GND plane.

2.  Place the PMID input capacitors as close to PMID and GND as possible. Place a 0.1 µF small size 
(such as
0402 or 0201) capacitor closer than the other 10 µF capacitors. Ground connections need to be tied 
to the
IC ground with a short copper trace connection or GND plane.

3.  Place the VBUS input capacitors as close to VBUS and GND as possible. Place a 0.1 µF small size 
(such as
0402 or 0201) capacitor closer than the other 10 µF capacitors. Ground connections need to be tied 
to the
IC ground with a short copper trace connection or GND plane.

4.  The connection from SYS/PMID/VBUS to the 0.1 µF has to be routed on the top layer of the PCB, 
the
returning back to GND also has to be in the top layer. Keep the whole routing loop as small as 
possible.

5.  Place the inductor input terminal to SW1 and the inductor output terminal to SW2 as close as 
possible.
Minimize                                                       the copper area of this trace to 
lower electrical and magnetic field radiation but make the trace
wide enough to carry the inductor current. Minimize parasitic capacitance from this area to any 
other trace or
plane.

6. Place the BAT capacitors close to BAT and GND, place the VBUS capacitors close to VBUS and GND.

7.  The REGN decoupling capacitor and the bootstrap capacitors should be placed next to the IC and 
make
trace                                                  connection as short as possible.

8. Ensure that there are sufficient thermal vias directly under the power MOSFETs, connecting to 
copper on
other layers.

9. Via size and number should be enough for a given current path.

10. Route BATP away from switching nodes such as SW1 and SW2.

Refer to the EVM design and more information in the BQ25792EVM, BQ25798EVM, and
BQ25798BKUPEVM                                                 (BMS034) Evaluation Module for the 
recommended component placement with trace
and via locations.

Figure 12-2. PCB Layout Example (Top Layer Copper Pours Removed on Left, Shown on Right)

Figure 12-2 shows the recommended placement and routing of external components. The components are
labelled with "R," "C" or "L" to indicate resistor, capacitor or inductor and a number that 
corresponds to the
numbered list in Section 12.1. Since the layout guidelines are listed in priority order, this 
number also provides a
priority for component placement.

The placement of C1 and C2 0.1 µF PMID and SYS capacitors is critical for noise filtering. They 
should be
placed on the same layer as the BQ25798, as close to the IC as possible. This will generally 
require that the
traces to connect SW1 and SW2 to the inductor are routed on a different layer.

The SW1 and SW2 pins are routed to vias placed under the IC and then back out on an inner PCB 
layer. This
supports the tightest placement of C1 and C2 capctiors as described above. These vias are also used 
to route to
the C7 BTST1 and BTST2 capactiors on the bottom layer as shown.
